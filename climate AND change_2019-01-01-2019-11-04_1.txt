['FED\'S KAPLAN SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE IMPACT ON U.S. GDP -  By Ann SaphirHOUSTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan said on Friday the U.S. central bank now has monetary policy at a "roughly" appropriate setting and should leave interest rates where they are for the time being. The Fed earlier this week cut its target for the overnight bank-to-bank lending rate for the third time this year, to a range of 1.5%-1.75%, moves Kaplan said he "strongly" supported.But he said now the Fed should "be patient and allow some time to unfold...The setting of monetary policy today is roughly appropriate, based on my outlook for the economy."

Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said Sanchez had offered to host the summit in Spain on the same days as previously scheduled, between Dec. 2 and Dec. 13.    "I hope that this generous offer from the president of Spain... represents a solution," Pinera said. "We have shared this information with the leading authorities at the United Nations."The so-called Conference of the Parties (COP) is the formal meeting of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). A spokesman earlier on Thursday said the UNFCCC was waiting to receive an official letter from Spain offering to host the talks and would then organize a meeting to assess the offer.Chile\'s withdrawal is the first time that a nation has pulled out of hosting the conference with just a month to go.Violent riots in recent days have left large parts of capital Santiago shut down, with its vital metro transport system suffering nearly $400 million in damage.

Chris Dignam has more.Short Link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2N0EuefVideo Transcript:Before Rex Tillerson was the ousted former US Secretary of State who said Washington was mean, This can be a very mean-spirited town. -he was the former CEO of ExxonMobil. And on Wednesday he took the witness stand in Manhattan state court to testify in a closely-watched civil lawsuit accusing the energy giant he once ran of hiding the true cost of climate change from investors. A case which began last week is the first of several climate change-related lawsuits by cities and counties across the US, pending against major oil companies to go to trial. The lawsuit brought by New York\'s Attorney General alleges that Exxon did not fully account for the impact of future climate change regulations on its business, resulting in losses to investors of up to $1.6 billion. Exxon has assailed the claims as "false and politically motivated." The case has also revealed that Tillerson used a secret e-mail account under the alter ego Wayne Tracker. The state said Exxon deleted e-mails from that account and ask the judge to rule that the missing e-mails be assumed damaging to Exxon\'s case. Theodore Wells, a lawyer for Exxon, has defended Tillerson in court, saying that after he became CEO in 2006, the company put in place a "robust system to manage the risk of increasing climate change" and said the alternate e-mail account was "entirely proper." New York and Massachusetts have both filed lawsuits accusing Exxon of misleading investors and consumers for decades about the role of fossil fuels play in climate change and are seeking funds to pay for sea walls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels. Exxon and the other oil and gas companies involved in the lawsuits said in court filings that they cannot be held liable for climate change.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.

Leaders and societies seeking to protect the well-being of their people may need to refocus on tougher issues, she said.Those could include what lifestyle changes people are willing to make to reduce climate risk and protect things they prize, such as securing their children\'s futures or being able to stay in their home nations rather than be forced to move."We need to understand what people value and what\'s acceptable or not," said Warner, who leads work on climate change impacts and risks for the U.N climate body.As more protesters take to the streets around the world, demanding faster climate action, governments will need to make policy shifts that are acceptable to both activists and the broader public - and "that\'s a hard needle to thread", she said.Dealing with growing climate threats also might require reshaping international institutions, she added.The U.N. climate secretariat, for instance, which oversaw the adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2015, focuses primarily on national-level action on climate threats.But with cities growing so fast - about 70% of the world\'s population will be urban by 2050, the United Nations predicts - much of the work to cut carbon emissions and build climate-safe infrastructure is happening at city level, Warner said.Today\'s international processes to fight climate change do not necessarily focus "where action needs to occur", she added.Reinhard Mechler, a scientist who looks at socio-economic aspects of disasters and climate change, said discussions on climate-related losses will need to explore more deeply damage to culture, traditions and heritage, as well as economies.Already, there is a move to examine "existential" threats, said Mechler of the Austria-based International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.U.N. climate talks in 2013 established the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, to explore ways of dealing with climate-related harm to people, property and nature. That mechanism is up for review at the next round of U.N. climate talks, scheduled for December.Digging into the wider implications of climate losses is important now as they have started to surge, Warner said.From small islands facing a decline in tourism as coral reefs deteriorate to Germany seeing its famed forests die off, "we are talking about profound change", she noted.

McNulty Prize, which recognizes individuals who are creating sustainable models for social change. Mothers Out Front is mobilizing more than 30,000 women and their children to demand those in power at all levels of US government take bold action that will accelerate the nations transition away from fossil fuels.Co-founded in 2013 by Wirth and Vanessa Rule, Mothers Out Front uses a proven model of grassroots organizing, and has trained and empowered mothers and others who are influencing decision-makers and showing up in force. Much of their work is focused on building power in frontline communities  low-income communities and communities of color that have been hit hardest by the health and environmental costs of the climate crisis.Climate change affects everyone, but it harms the vulnerable and marginalized most of all, said former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, chair of the McNulty Prize Jury. We need courage and leadership on this issue now more than ever. If anything can move politicians to act, it\'s an organized and diverse movement of mothers fighting for their childrens futures."\xa0It was that same paradigm shift that propelled Kelsey Wirth to found her organization. If a car was driving down the street and my daughter ran in front of it, I would throw myself between her and the car. Thats how I came to understand climate change, not as a citizen, but as a mother.Unable to sit idly by while her daughters stood to inherit an increasingly poisoned planet, Wirth organized meetings in her home with other moms in her Massachusetts neighborhood. What started there has grown into a 30,000-strong force, with more than 45 mother-led teams driving change in 10 states, with more states on the horizon.\xa0To be a mother is to think about the future, said McNulty Foundation President and Aspen Institute Trustee Anne Welsh McNulty. Mothers Out Front taps into the unique voice and moral authority of moms, parents and all those who are hard-wired to protect their children, and engages them in direct actions in their communities. They are winning results across the country.Think Globally, Fight Locally, Win EverywhereThe organizations teams of moms have hit the pavement and achieved real wins. In Massachusetts, groups of mothers physically tagged and cataloged hundreds of methane leaks in gas pipelines  leaks that account for an estimated ten percent of the states greenhouse gas emissions. Their campaign was instrumental in Massachusetts committing to reduce its statewide carbon emissions by five percent.Other wins have resulted in pipeline regulations to address methane leaks, the halting of new fossil fuel infrastructure in frontline communities in New York and Virginia, and increasing renewable energy use, including passing the nations largest community clean energy program in California, and replacing diesel school buses with new fleets of electric buses.The movement is rapidly growing across the United States. It\'s about creating a space and a movement for everyone who is concerned for our children\'s wellbeing, everyone who wants to ensure that children born into the world today can grow up in the kind of world that we want for them, says Kelsey Wirth.Find out more at mothersoutfront.org, and watch the McNulty Foundations micro-documentary on Mothers Out Front at mcnultyfound.org.\xa0The John P. McNulty Prize was founded by Anne Welsh McNulty in memory of her late husband, to recognize the boldness and impact of individuals using their expertise and entrepreneurial talents to address the worlds toughest challenges. A distinguished jury, including former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Ugandan statesman Olara Otunnu, international development expert Brizio Biondi-Morra and Ford Foundation president Darren Walker selected the 2019 winner. Previous juries have included Mary Robinson, Bill Gates, Sr. and Sir Richard Branson, among others.Henry Crown Fellow Kelsey Wirth was one of four McNulty Prize Laureates selected from the Aspen Global Leadership Network.

Over the course of the event, 125 speakers engaged in conversations across dozens of topics focusing on the greater theme of urban innovation. Sessions addressed the use of data to help communities address homelessness; gun violence in cities; affordable housing; decriminalizing poverty; the impact of technology on health and employment; scooters and the micro-mobility revolution; local problem solving; climate change; 5G and the digital divide; surveillance in cities; self-driving cars; governance within a digital city; reinvestment into cities; workers that help drive a city\'s economy; city regulation around the gig economy; and the cultural impact of music.\n\n    \n                \n\n    \nCityLab DC gathered over 500 city leaders, practitioners, planners, architects, artists, economists, business leaders, tech innovators, urban scholars, and other civic leadersrepresenting 169 cities across 30 countries. Forty-four mayors attended CityLab DC from the U.S., Europe, Africa, and Latin America.\nThe second day convened an important discussion with Mayor Muriel Bowser and Stacey Stewart, President and CEO, March of Dimes, in a session titled, "Healing the Divide in Maternal Health." In 2019, American women are more than twice as likely to die of pregnancy-related causes than they were in 1987. More American women are dying of pregnancy-related complications than women in any other developed country. And only in the U.S. is the rate of maternal mortality on the rise. Mayor Bowser has launched an Infant and Maternal Health Initiative called\xa0Maternal Mondays in Washington, D.C. to help raise awareness and provide resources to new mothers and babies in the District.\n"It\'s not enough to say do we have insurance. But do people feel heard and respected when they go to see their doctors?," Bowser said. "Part of the data suggests to us that the closer we can get to the grassroots and supporting women, the more likely they are to trust those providers. We know that we can provide more supportive environments for them during their pregnancy," she added. "All of that information is going to help us build a government that supports women and families."\nStewart spoke of the need for community collaboration for mother and infant care, saying, "There\'s no one sector, not one entity alone that can solve this. What we know about premature birth and infant mortality, is that it has to do with not only what happens in the doctor\'s office, but it has to do very much with how women live.access to transportation, access to healthcare, housing, and all of the kinds of factors that affect a woman\'s life."\nIn a closing session, David Grohl called for cities to embrace all-ages music venues to create more opportunities for younger residents to develop their passion for music, and help foster an increased sense of community. \nConversations and insights from featured speakers on Day 2 included:\nIn a session by Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, Professor of Peace Studies from the University of California San Diego called, "The Street: Ground Zero for Democracy," he examined the future of free speech in cities and the role public space plays in facilitating it. He also spoke about the role of city leadersfrom mayors to law enforcementfinding ways to ensure that all residents feel respected and safe to share their views. "Protests on a regular basis are changing the way we think about our lives, the way we think about our cities, and sometimes, the way we think about ourselves," Choi-Fitzpatrick said.With protests occurring around the world to effect change in government, Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz Soto of San Juan, Puerto Rico was interviewed by Mary Louise Kelly, Host of All Things Considered, NPR, on the impact of recent protests in Puerto Rico that culminated in the resignation of Governor Ricardo Rosello. The Mayor took an opportunity to discuss the impact of hurricanes on Puerto Rico and the country\'s rebuilding in the wake of Hurricane Maria. In an emotional reflection on the citizen response from the U.S. to Hurricane Maria, Cruz Soto thanked American volunteers for their support, "While the federal government turned its back on us, we are very cognisant that the American people opened their hearts to us. You fed us. You gave us water. You took care of our wounds. And when the federal administration could not find its way, you found your way. "Taking a page from the eclectic food scene in Washington, Author and Chef Kwame Onwuachi of Kith/Kin discussed his culinary and personal journey spanning Nigeria and New York with Senior Editor of The Atlantic, Ron Brownstein. Onwuachi said "on a plate of food, you can cross nations. You can cross cultures. It\'s the only true art form that you actually ingest." As the U.S. prepares for the 2020 Census, Derek Thompson of The Atlantic interviewed Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza and Terri Ann Lowenthal of Funders Census Initiative to discuss how we can make sure every resident is counted in this critical 10-year national survey. "Every census has its challenges. Every census has its controversies," said Lowenthal. "I am particularly worried that the 2020 Census is facing a set of unprecedented challenges that could thwart the success of the census." Mayor Elorza spoke of the need to ensure an accurate census in the coming year. "The census touches everything that we care about," said Elorza. "We need accurate data to move the needle to improve the lives of all of our residents. The census is the foundation of all of that."The Atlantic\'s Deputy Editor Gillian White moderated a discussion between Ai-jen Poo, Co-founder and Executive Director, National Domestic Workers Alliance, and Jose Antonio Vargas, Author of "Notes of an Undocumented Citizen," unpacked the role that day laborers, restaurant workers, and domestic workers - both legal and undocumented - play in their cities and how the shadow economy shapes city life for all. In explaining the shadow economy in cities, Poo said "If you\'re looking for signs of the future, you look to the margins. Not just for the problems that are potentially the threats to potentially to come in the future for everyone, but also the solutions. A lot of the most innovative ideas have been happening in the shadows. That can actually benefit millions of workers in the future, and cities are taking the lead." Vargas spoke of the public sentiment toward immigrants in this country, adding, "the anti-immigrant narrative has spread like a virus so wide that it has elected a president."Tommi Laitio, Executive Director of Culture and Leisure for the City of Helsinki, Finland, shared a presentation about the reinvention, both inside and out, of public libraries in Finland, as well as the public services they provide. "Schools and libraries have played a crucial role in making the country and Helsinki the city what it is at the moment," said Laitio. "If we look at the contemporary challenges in our cities, we have to think about the role of libraries in a larger way." The day closed out with an enlightening and entertaining session with esteemed Musician and Filmmaker, Dave Grohl, of Nirvana and Foo Fighters. Grohl spoke with The Atlantic\'s Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg about the local and cultural impact of music and the cities like Washington, D.C. and Seattle, WA that have influenced him: "The music then becomes the soundtrack of that city." He then added, "A community that has a rich and exciting vibrant music scene - I think that it brings a lot of happiness to the place where it is."Yesterday CityLab\'s mainstage programming featured a joint welcome by Bloomberg Philanthropies CEO Patricia E.

In some areas, such as the Alps, extra water from glaciers has caused flash floods while shrinking snow cover in the Andes has led to droughts in places like Chile. Scientists gathered for a "High Mountain Summit" at the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in Geneva this week are seeking better cooperation between governments, researchers and space agencies."We are woefully underprepared. Our infrastructure was built in the 19th and 20th centuries in the mountains and downstream of the mountains and we don\'t have that climate any more," said John Pomeroy, a professor at Canada\'s University of Saskatchewan, who is co-chairing the event.Switzerland, the host country, estimates that damage to its infrastructure, including railways, caused by climate change could cost 1 billion Swiss francs ($1 billion) a year. But many poorer countries experiencing similar challenges are unlikely to have funds on that scale to fix problems."There are quite some gaps not only in the way our infrastructure has been designed but also the infrastructure we have in place to monitor for change," said Carolina Adler, executive director of the Mountain Research Initiative at the University of Bern who is the summit\'s other chair.To cope with the effects of climate change on water systems, dams will have to be redesigned and irrigation systems overhauled, Pomeroy added. SENSITIVE DATAUnlike weather data, which U.N. member states have shared voluntarily with the WMO for decades, the pooling of data on water is in its infancy.One challenge will be persuading governments to commit to share more information on hydrology. One official described this as "very sensitive", with some governments deeming this a question of national security. Adler said cooperation was nonetheless required to avoid tensions -- such as those between India and Pakistan over water supplies after New Delhi released water from a dam in August -- and to avert conflict.  (Full Story)The summit is expected to create the Integrated High Mountain Observation and Prediction Project intended to help deal with hazards through early warning systems, according to a draft list of aims seen by Reuters.It also urges greater collaboration between space agencies on satellite images of mountain areas."We may decide that some communities are located in inherently dangerous situations and need to be moved and migration may be part of this, so these are very serious considerations," said Pomeroy.($1 = 0.9957 Swiss francs) (Editing by Gareth Jones)(( emma.farge@thomsonreuters.com ;))(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.

With a growing number of policymakers discussing financial risk from extreme weather events, incoming ECB President Christine Lagarde recently argued that it should be a priority for central banks and supervisors to look at how they can contribute to mitigating climate change. Weidmann argued that while climate change risk is not sufficiently priced into assets and most banks still fail to take such risks into consideration, it would be wrong to use bank regulation or monetary policy to achieve political goals."A monetary policy that explicitly pursues environmental goals risks being overburdened," he told a conference. "And in the long term, its independence could be called into question."He said that buying a disproportionate share of green bonds, as suggested by some ECB watchers, would violate the principle of market neutrality.Weidmann also argued against using bank regulation, such as risk weights on haircuts on financial assets, to achieve climate change goals as regulation should be aligned with actual risk. "Incentives for climate protection, on the other hand, are a matter for politics," he added.Weidmann acknowledged that two thirds of banks do not take climate change into account in risks management and the cost of climate change is not fully priced in by markets.    He also said violent weather events can lead to more volatile growth and inflation rates, making it even more difficult to set monetary policy.

The group is providing technical support to the plaintiffs, as it has done in similar cases in other countries in which children have sued their governments because of climate change - including the Netherlands, the United States and India.The Canadian plaintiffs are suing under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects individual autonomy and personal rights, as well as section 15, which guarantees equality rights. The Charter is part of the Canadian Constitution.The statement of claim filed in a federal court in Vancouver on Friday by the plaintiffs alleges that "despite knowing for decades" that carbon emissions "cause climate change and disproportionately harm children," the government continued to allow emissions to increase at a level "incompatible with a stable climate capable of sustaining human life and liberties."It specifically cites the government\'s purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which carries oil from Alberta to British Columbia\'s coast, as an action that contributed to climate change.

"I am now and in the future going to be faced with extreme consequences because of climate change. This lawsuit is the best way for me to move forward in my action against climate change."Reinhart-Smith has participated in climate activism in the past, including with Greta Thunberg\'s Fridays for the Future movement, but he felt protesting corporations and lobbying politicians was not effective enough."It was still depending on them to do the actions," he said. If the lawsuit is successful, the government will have to act "by order of the court, rather than listen to some youth that are telling them it\'s the best way to go."Reinhart-Smith and the other plaintiffs are represented by Arvay Finlay LLP and Tollefson Law Corporation, and have partnered with the Pacific Centre for Environmental Law and Litigation and the David Suzuki Foundation.In the United States, 21 activists aged 11 to 22 sued the federal government in 2015 for violating their rights to due process under the U.S. Constitution by failing to adequately address carbon pollution such as emissions from burning of fossil fuels.

FaroukSAHEL SELIM, Egypt, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -  In a small village 45 minutes from the city of Assiut, in southern Egypt, a group of farmers and their families gathered to watch a theatre performance that aimed to find the funny side of climate change.   The hour-long comedy, which has so far been performed in 50 villages in the Upper Egypt region, in the country\'s south, tells the story of a farmer who refuses to pay for a new, more water-efficient agricultural canal.When a snake bites him and he is thought to be dead, the farmer hears how much his family and neighbours hated him because he rejected modern farming methods. At the end of the show, he changes his perspective.The play is part of a $7-million project funded by the World Food Programme (WFP) and managed by the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture that aims to help farmers in the region cope better with climate change threats through modern technology, sustainable growing techniques and better understanding of climate issues.Organisers say the project, which started in 2013 and is scheduled to end early next year, has boosted the production of some major crops by at least a third and drastically cut water consumption on the farms involved. It is one in a series of efforts the Egyptian government has made over the past decade to limit the negative impact of climate change on farmers across the country."Community mobilisation on the issue of climate change can encourage many people to embrace the ideas of the project. And theatre is one of the methods to mobilise the community," said Ayam Abu el-Hagag, an actor in the traveling troupe and also an agricultural advisor.He noted that each time the troupe delivers a joke on stage, the characters explain the information to make it accessible to all farmers, even those with little or no formal education."Comedy helps people understand things easier," he added.HIGHLY VULNERABLEClimate change has been a major challenge for Egypt and according to the WFP, "southern Egypt is one of the areas most vulnerable to climate change within the region".Environmental groups regard Egypt as one of the countries most threatened by the negative effects of climate change, which include sea-level rise, water poverty, and deteriorating public health and ecosystems.   The WFP forecasts that Upper Egypt could lose up to 30% of its food production by 2050 as climate change brings more extreme weather and other threats.Saber Osman, director of the climate change adaptation department at Egypt\'s Ministry of Environment, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that losses could lead to a major crisis for Egypt\'s farming sector.Agriculture represents almost 15% of the country\'s gross domestic product and employs about a third of the workforce, he said.The idea behind the WFP project is to get farmers involved in the frontline fight against climate change and stamp out bad farming habits, said the project\'s director, Othman el-Sheikh.That includes encouraging farmers to plant crop varieties that require less water and to follow new irrigation methods to reduce water consumption.Farmers also learn how to combine traditional farming techniques with more modern technology, such as solar-powered irrigation pumps and an app that alerts farmers to incoming weather events.One main focus for the project is to help farmers work together, to cut the cost of seeds by buying them in bulk and planting them across several neighbouring farms, el-Sheikh explained."Fragmented agricultural holdings are common throughout Egypt in general and in Upper Egypt in particular," he said.When they work independently, many farmers cannot afford to access high-quality resources, which lowers their productivity and leads to about 10% of land lying fallow, he added.       The initiative helps farmers organise into groups of at least 70, who agree to pool their resources.Every planting season, the Society Development Association in Sahel Selim, which is working with the WFP on the project, buys enough seed for all 70 farmers and divides the seeds equally among them.The farmers carry out the sowing and eventual harvesting together, cutting costs by sharing equipment and manpower, el-Sheikh explained.The hope is that once the project ends, the farmer groups will be making enough revenue to allow them to buy high-quality seeds for themselves, he said. El-Sheikh added that almost 2,000 farms have been consolidated into larger farming groups through the project in the past three years.  FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCEThe WFP project also runs a loan program that provides villagers with goats and ducks to give them an alternative source of income in case their crops fail.Sabrine Haridi, a 33-year-old mother of four children in Sahel Selim, said she got a loan to acquire 38 ducks, which allow her to cover the family\'s expenses, even in seasons when her husband\'s wheat harvest falls short. She sells some of the ducks for their meat and rears more from eggs, selling them when they mature. Any profit she makes goes toward paying off the loan."Two years ago, I was desperate because my husband could not afford our daily needs. I am now financially independent," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation."When my husband fails to get the expected money from his crop due to climate change, I pay for whatever we need, including food, clothes and school expenses," she added.\'IN GOD\'S HANDS\'Since the project was launched in Egypt in 2013, half a million farmers have become involved, said el-Sheikh He told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that applying the new methods has increased wheat production by 30% to 40%, boosted sugarcane output by about 30% and reduced water consumption by a third.But getting to that point was not easy, said Osman at the environment ministry."Community resistance to adopting methods for coping with climate change is common in Egyptian villages," he said, adding that some farmers do not see climate change as an issue that can be addressed because it is "in God\'s hands".El-Sheikh said that some farmers used to ask him, "What would you do to combat climate change? Would you change God\'s weather?"He told them the efforts only aimed to help farmers cope with changing weather, not shift the weather itself."Convincing farmers to use modern technology and advanced agricultural means, as well as encouraging women to take part in the project, are some of the biggest challenges we face," El Sheikh added.Hassan Bekheet, 53, said he didn\'t need much convincing to swap his maize crops for drought-tolerant sorghum when he joined the project in Sahel Selim. Once he made the switch, his crop yield increased by about 25%, as did his revenues, he said, while his costs went down by 15%.   He was so happy with what he learned from the project that he got together with other participants to pass those lessons on to neighbours.   "We are all in the same boat and we should fight these changes together," Bekheet said. (Reporting by Menna A. Farouky; Editing by Jumana Farouky and Laurie Goering.

(Full Story)The lawsuit in Suffolk County Superior Court in Boston alleged Exxon systematically misled investors about climate-driven risks to its business and deceived auto drivers and other consumers about the role fossil fuel products play in causing climate change."Our goal here is simple: to stop Exxon from engaging in this deception and penalize it for this conduct," Healey told reporters.Her lawsuit, the culmination of a three-year investigation, was filed two hours after a judge rejected a last-minute bid by Exxon to force Healey to hold-off from moving forward with her plans to sue it.In court papers, Exxon called the decision by Healey to sue now "gamesmanship" to distract its lawyers amid the New York trial and part of a "partisan" campaign against it."We look forward to refuting the meritless allegations in court," Exxon said in a statement.Healey, a Democrat, and her New York counterpart launched investigations into Exxon following news reports in 2015 saying company scientists determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change. Those news reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.Healey in 2016 issued a so-called civil investigative demand to Exxon seeking documents to determine whether it had violated  Massachusetts consumer-protection law through its marketing and sale of fossil fuel products. The company fought the records request, and while courts have sided with Healey, the company to this day has not provided her office any records. The state built its lawsuit on evidence from other sources, including New York\'s case, Healey said.In its 2018 lawsuit, New York accuses Exxon of falsely telling investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business, defrauding investors out of up to $1.6 billion.Exxon denies wrongdoing and says it has a robust system to manage the risk of increasing climate change.

Militants also exploited climate crises to win legitimacy, he added.The overthrow of President Siad Barre in 1991 plunged Somalia into almost three decades of violent turmoil - first at the hands of clan warlords then Islamist militants, Al Shabaab, which wants to topple Somalia\'s central government.The insurgents, who are allied with al Qaeda, were driven out of the capital Mogadishu in 2011. They have now lost nearly all their territory but continue to carry out attacks.Add climate problems to the political instability and ever-present threat of violence, and a lasting peace becomes elusive. HORN OF AFRICAClimate change is taking a toll right across the Horn of Africa, with increasingly erratic weather and low rainfall common in Kenya, Somalia, Uganda and Ethiopia.The recurring dry spells destroy crops and pastures, pushing millions of people to the brink of extreme hunger. According to the U.N., more than 2.5 million people in Somalia have been forced from their homes by drought and insecurity in recent years; many are now at risk of starvation. The report said rising conflict between cattle herders and farmers over water and land was a challenge for UNSOM, while people on the move were vulnerable to recruitment by Al Shabaab."Climate impacts have contributed to an increase in the number of IDPs (internally displaced people) that moved to urban areas, such as Mogadishu, and who are living in improvised camps," said the report. "These camps have become hotspots for criminal activities such as human trafficking and child exploitation, and a recruitment ground for Al Shabaab."A pickup in migration has also robbed UNSOM of the elders who typically mediate conflicts, leaving a gap in local governance, researchers added.The report found Al Shabaab had learned to take advantage of natural disasters by helping victims and legitimising its power."Al Shabaab collects food and money through its distribution centres, to provide disaster relief to those affected," it said."The increasingly cyclical occurrence of drought, flood and famine assures Al Shabaab the opportunity to showcase its position as a relief provider."UNSOM said it "broadly" agreed with the report, but disputed researchers\' belief there was a lack of donor awareness about the heavy social impact of environmental problems.

Developed to raise awareness of the massive risks of climate change and pollution to our oceans and coastlines, the Rising Seas wetsuit is an urgent call to all coastal enthusiasts to demand climate action from our nation\'s leaders. Supporters are asked to sign an action alert\xa0that will be sent directly to elected officials and hand-delivered to Congress.\n"The stakes are high and this wetsuit is our reality unless we act now," said Surfrider\'s Marketing Director, Eddie Anaya. "Our waterways are being polluted with toxic sewage, runoff and plastics. Sea levels are rising and threatening our beaches. The Rising Seas wetsuit concept is a stark glimpse into what every surfer and coastal enthusiast faces if we don\'t take immediate action to address climate change impacts and pollution. Together with Vissla, we\'re calling on everyone who cares about the ocean and coasts to let their voices be heard and demand action from elected officials to protect our ocean, waves and beaches for the future."\nClean water and healthy beaches are critical to the nation\'s coastal economies, communities, and recreation industries. In fact, coastal recreation and tourism constitute about 2.4 million jobs and contribute more than $124 billion to the U.S. economy every year. However, the ocean and coasts are increasingly at risk from plastic and water pollution, offshore oil drilling, ocean acidification and rising sea levels. Pollution at recreational beaches costs the U.S. economy more than $2.2 billion and results in 20,000 health advisories annually. Melting land ice and glaciers are causing sea levels to rise at an accelerated rate, altering ocean circulation and changing the ocean\'s chemistry.\xa0\n"The Rising Seas Wetsuit project is a sobering reality check that we all have to engage in and take a stand to reverse the environmental decline of our oceans, waves and beaches," said Vissla\'s CEO, Paul Naude. "The thought that we may need this conceptual wetsuit in the future is frightening. We hope the message here stimulates a call to action for everyone to get actively involved in demanding that governments  local, state and national  take urgent steps to address the environmental issues at hand. We\'re asking everyone who cares about a healthy planet to help us to never have to produce this wetsuit."\nThe Surfrider Foundation and Vissla are calling on the public to make their voices heard and join Surfrider\'s virtual march on Washington, D.C. to urge federal leaders to take action on coastal protection issues. Signatures from Surfrider\'s action alert\xa0will be sent immediately to congressional representatives and then hand-delivered to Congress by Surfrider and recreation industry representatives during the upcoming Coastal Recreation Hill Day.\nThe innovative Rising Seas concept was developed by veteran creative directors Scott Brown and Alex Kemp, owners of the underground surf shop Lone Wolfs Objets d\'Surf.

(Full Story)The lawsuit claimed Exxon falsely told investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business using a "proxy cost" of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions, but internally used figures as low as $40 per ton or none at all."Exxon only ever told its investors about a single set of assumptions," Kevin Wallace, acting chief of the New York Attorney General\'s Investor Protection Bureau, told Ostrager Tuesday."What we are saying, and the law demands, is that Exxon not mislead its investors," he said.Theodore Wells, a lawyer for Exxon, said that after Tillerson became chief executive in 2006, the company put in place a "robust system" to manage the risk of increasing climate change.He said the $80 per ton proxy cost represented a "global," "macro level" assessment of the cost, while lower figures, known as greenhouse gas or GHG costs, were used for particular capital projects."There is no document that says ... proxy costs and GHG costs were one and the same," he said.Wells also accused former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman of bringing the case for political reasons."They didn\'t stay in their lane of objectivity and fairness," he said.Massachusetts is separately investigating whether Exxon concealed its knowledge of the role fossil fuels play in climate change.

(Full Story)The Global Fund, an alliance of governments, civil society and private sector partners, is pursuing a United Nations target of ending the three epidemics by 2030. Warmer ocean surface waters are increasing the intensity and frequency of storms. The Fund had sent emergency resources after flooding caused by Cyclone Idai resulted in thousands of new malaria cases in Mozambique this year. "There are indirect effects (of climate change) on TB and HIV because if people are displaced by environmental or climate change reasons they are likely to be more vulnerable to these diseases," he added.At a conference hosted in October by French President Emmanuel Macron, the Global Fund secured record funding pledges of just over $14 billion for three years.  (Full Story) Sands, former chief executive officer of Standard Chartered bank, said the world\'s ability to hit the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the U.N. on the three diseases would partly depend on whether countries implement increases in healthcare spending of $46 billion over the same period. African countries in particular are being urged to increase spending to 15 percent of their budgets on healthcare -- a big jump for many.     "It\'s not going to be delivered simply by persistence from players like Global Fund or by bilateral assistance," he said.Of the three epidemics, progress on TB has been the slowest, although there has been recent progress in identifying a greater portion of the millions of undiagnosed cases, he said.Malaria infected 219 million people worldwide in 2017, killing 435,000, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Most of the victims were babies or young children in sub-Saharan Africa.

 By Michael TaylorKUALA LUMPUR, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The potential for a global tree-planting drive to curb climate-change risks has been overestimated, scientists warned, flagging issues with maps and data used in a recent study and urging greater efforts to cut heat-trapping emissions by other means.In July, researchers at the Crowther Lab, based at Swiss university ETH Zurich, published a study suggesting the best way to keep climate change in check would be to replant trees on destroyed forest areas the size of the United States.  (Full Story) But in a response letter published in the same journal Science on Friday, scientists at the University of Bonn and Nairobi-based research centre World Agroforestry said there were limits on the number of trees that could be grown on lands included in the initial study.Eike Luedeling, a professor at the University of Bonn\'s Institute of Crop Sciences and Resource Conservation, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that reforestation should not be seen as a substitute for curbing emissions from using fossil fuels."Yes, we can all plant trees... and if we still keep emitting carbon dioxide like crazy, we will not have solved anything - we just bought a little bit of time," he said."If we want to control climate change, there is really only one answer... we have to cut emissions," he added by phone.Environmentalists say protecting existing forests and restoring damaged ones prevents flooding, stores planet-warming carbon, limits climate change and protects biodiversity. (Full Story)But the tropics lost 12 million hectares of tree cover in 2018, the fourth-highest annual loss since records began in 2001, according to monitoring service Global Forest Watch.Of greatest concern, it said, was the disappearance of 3.6 million hectares of old-growth rainforest, an area the size of Belgium, much due to fires, land-clearing for farms and mining.Crowther Lab scientists this year published what they said was the first study of how many trees the world could support, where they could be grown, and how much carbon they could store.The study analysed the maximum amount of carbon that could be captured if all available degraded forest areas not used by humans were replanted and allowed to mature.But researchers at the University of Bonn and World Agroforestry questioned its findings in their letter.The Crowther Lab\'s classification of many "high-potential" regions for tree planting was based on average temperatures and did not take into account the highest and lowest temperatures experienced in places like the tundra and Africa\'s savannas, said Luedeling.In addition, soils in many deforested areas are eroded or otherwise degraded so the success of reforestation efforts would likely be limited, the letter said, adding that some of the maps and data on uninhabited areas were not accurate.Problems were also encountered with the initial study\'s inclusion of pasture land, currently being used for livestock farming, as potential reforestation areas, it added.Villages, smaller settlements and even some large cities, such as Kinshasa, the capital of Democratic Republic of Congo, were also counted as potential sites for tree planting."Around 2.5 billion people live in the areas that the study recommends for reforestation," said Luedeling. "It is very questionable whether these regions are really suitable."Tom Crowther, a professor at the Crowther Lab, was unable to provide an immediate comment on the letter.Luedeling and his colleagues nonetheless welcomed the idea of \u200b\u200brewilding land where possible because of the enormous benefits to ecosystems."Reforestation buys us time that we urgently need," said Luedeling. "But it can only be one building block in a comprehensive strategy to avoid catastrophic climate change."     (Reporting by Michael Taylor @MickSTaylor; Editing by Megan Rowling.

The FSB coordinates financial rules for G20 countries.Though 80 percent of the companies in the Moody\'s sample said climate change was affecting strategic decisions, just two of the 28 linked their climate projections with an effect on cash flows and balance sheets, the report said.Those companies were a European utility and U.S. oil and gas company, the report said without giving names. Companies the credit ratings service used in its analysis have a combined $877 billion of debt. They included Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L, Duke Energy Corp DUK.N and Eletricite de France SA EDF.PA, among others.Although companies have made some progress in the level of disclosure they provide, standardised and consistent quantification of the financial impact from climate risks is still in a nascent stage," Vincent Allilaire, one of the authors of the report, said in a statement.While climate-related disclosures overall are up, the quality and depth of reporting varies widely, Moody\'s said.Many investors have called on companies to provide better information on how climate change could impact their businesses amid concerns that assets are being mispriced because the risk is not being factored in.Nevertheless, Moody\'s characterized the widespread adoption of climate-related financial disclosures as "slow and gradual."

"Precision neurology eliminates clinician guesswork, empowering patients to receive an accurate diagnosis regardless of location or individual expertise of attending neurologist," said Alkuraya.\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® (BRAIN) Initiative Focuses on Measuring Circuit ActivityNew technologies have revolutionized the ability for scientists to map, monitor and modulate brain activity in mice and other animal models. These advances have the potential to close a major gap in neurology and allow researchers to study the brain activities that underlie patients\' symptoms. To achieve this goal, the NIH BRAIN Initiative is focused on helping researchers study neural circuits under healthy and diseased conditions. "The brain has 85 billion cells firing in patterns and the big challenge is to understand what these patterns mean," says Walter Koroshetz, MD, Director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). "As these new technologies advance, they could present the ability to develop new therapies based on normalizing or compensating for abnormal circuit activity." \nNovel New Strategies in Bionic Extremity Reconstruction\xa0Massive central or peripheral tissue damage, in many cases, poses a major reconstructive challenge with few therapeutic options. Bionic Reconstruction can restore extremity function in the face of severe central and peripheral nerve lesion, and enable patients to interact with mechatronic devices in an intuitive and natural way. "We developed different strategies that combine complex technical systems with sophisticated surgical techniques to create novel neurological landscapes so that patients can interact with complex mechatronic devices in an intuitive and natural way," says Oskar Aszmann, MD, Professor of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at the Medical University of Vienna and presenter at the Congress.\xa0\xa0 \nUpdates in Imaging to Transform Field of NeurologyThe scientific understanding of neuroimaging through research and the use of artificial intelligence, including machine and deep learning, has expanded.

"Precision neurology eliminates clinician guesswork, empowering patients to receive an accurate diagnosis regardless of location or individual expertise of attending neurologist," said Alkuraya.\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® (BRAIN) Initiative Focuses on Measuring Circuit ActivityNew technologies have revolutionized the ability for scientists to map, monitor and modulate brain activity in mice and other animal models. These advances have the potential to close a major gap in neurology and allow researchers to study the brain activities that underlie patients\' symptoms. To achieve this goal, the NIH BRAIN Initiative is focused on helping researchers study neural circuits under healthy and diseased conditions. "The brain has 85 billion cells firing in patterns and the big challenge is to understand what these patterns mean," says Walter Koroshetz, MD, Director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). "As these new technologies advance, they could present the ability to develop new therapies based on normalizing or compensating for abnormal circuit activity." \nNovel New Strategies in Bionic Extremity Reconstruction\xa0Massive central or peripheral tissue damage, in many cases, poses a major reconstructive challenge with few therapeutic options. Bionic Reconstruction can restore extremity function in the face of severe central and peripheral nerve lesion, and enable patients to interact with mechatronic devices in an intuitive and natural way. "We developed different strategies that combine complex technical systems with sophisticated surgical techniques to create novel neurological landscapes so that patients can interact with complex mechatronic devices in an intuitive and natural way," says Oskar Aszmann, MD, Professor of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at the Medical University of Vienna and presenter at the Congress.\xa0\xa0 \nUpdates in Imaging to Transform Field of NeurologyThe scientific understanding of neuroimaging through research and the use of artificial intelligence, including machine and deep learning, has expanded. With advanced neuroimaging, automated reports and objective parameters will become more commonplace, while simultaneously making it easier for neurologists to explain imaging findings to their patients. "These advancements could transform the field of neurology by promoting our understanding of functional and structural correlates of neurologic disorders," Christian Enzinger, MD, MBA, Associate Professor at the Medical University of Graz in Austria.\nStroke and Vascular Dementia Press ConferenceNew advancements in research reveal a relationship between stroke and dementia, in that vascular changes of the brain through hypertension increase the incidence of dementia. With that in mind, research suggests preventative measures to reduce small vessel vascular disease could mitigate the prevalence of people with dementia. During a press conference featuring some of the world\'s leading experts in stroke, will discuss how taking preventative stroke measures may be able to reduce the risk of dementia, and how to ensure that knowledge translates to regions throughout the world. The press conference will take place Monday, Oct. 28 at 3:15 pm. Gulf Standard Time.\nGlobal Economic Impact of Migraine Press ConferenceIn 2019, the World Federation of Neurology partnered with the International Headache Society\'s Global Patient Advocacy Coalition (IHS-GPAC) to spread global awareness about migraine. In a joint press conference, representatives from IHS, WFN and patient organizations around the world will discuss how to carry the momentum from World Brain Day into the workplace and beyond. The press conference will take place Tuesday, Oct. 29 at 8:00 am Gulf Standard Time.\nThe Congress is poised to bring the world\'s leaders in science\xa0to accelerate the pace of change around the globe. Additional breaking news releases will be distributed during the week. Media are welcome to attend on-site, on Facebook\xa0or request interviews at press@yakketyyak.com. \nAbout the World Federation of NeurologyThe World Federation of Neurology represents 120 member neurological societies around the globe to foster quality neurology and brain health worldwide by promoting neurological education and training with an emphasis on under-resourced areas of the world.

"It is not a green wave, it is a tsunami, a hurricane,"   Celine Vara, deputy Greens leader who won a seat in the upper house of parliament for Neuchatel canton, told Swiss radio.     Far from the sea, Switzerland is especially vulnerable to climate change as temperatures in the country are rising twice as quickly as the global average."I think it is pretty obvious that is the most important topic of all in our time and age. There is really not any time to lose," said Anja, a 25-year-old psychology student, who gave only her first name at a Bern polling station.The SVP, which won a record number of seats in 2015 amid Europe\'s refugee crisis, slipped 3.6 points to 25.8% while the Greens\' share surged 5.9 points to 13.0% of the vote for the lower house, according to a gfs.bern projection for broadcaster SRF.     The smaller, more centrist Green Liberal Party (GLP) advanced to 7.9%, bringing the two parties\' combined strength to nearly 21% should they overcome policy differences and decide to join forces. Together they gained 26 seats in the 200-seat lower house, potentially putting them in line to take one of the seats in the seven-seat cabinet, the Federal Council.    Changing just one member of the cabinet would be a political sensation. The Greens have never had a seat in the federal government.    The centre-left Social Democrats remained second on 16.6% and the centre-right Liberals (FDP) third at 15.3%, but the Greens leapfrogged the centrist Christian Democrats (CVP), which has one seat on the Federal Council.Cabinet seats have been divvied up among the SVP, SP, FDP and CVP in nearly the same way since 1959. The three biggest parties get two seats and the fourth-biggest gets one under the informal "magic formula" system. "The Federal Council in its current composition no longer fits (the changed political situation)," Greens leader Regula Rytz told Swiss TV, suggesting the party could seek to wrest a cabinet seat from the FDP.In December, the two parliamentary chambers will elect the government. In the past it has taken more than one national election cycle for that selection procedure to change the cabinet lineup to more closely reflect the results of voting.The election of two new cabinet members after resignations last year also complicates the matter for the Greens by making it necessary to vote out a sitting member, an unusual step. The election campaign was light on typical hot-button issues such as migration and Swiss ties with the European Union that have given the anti-EU SVP a boost in the past.    Switzerland\'s system of direct democracy gives voters a final say on major issues decided by referendum.

Effective mitigation of climate change will require all parts of our economy and society to take broad, coordinated action. "Every one of us has a role to play in reducing our impact on climate change, and increasingly, the world\'s largest companies are stepping up with concrete actions," said Dr. Cynthia Telles, chair of the Community Health Committee for Kaiser Permanente and director of the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Hispanic Neuropsychiatric Center of Excellence.\nClimate scientists tell us that our planet faces potentially devastating effects from climate change in the coming decades, many of which we are already experiencing. A recent global survey of 300 of the world\'s largest multinational businesses revealed several ways that global businesses are already weathering climate impacts. From increased wildfires to supply chain impacts and business operation disruptions, climate change is affecting businesses across the planet.\nThis new research highlights the important role businesses can and are playing in the worldwide effort to address climate change. Titled "Towards Net Zero: How business is rising to the challenge", this survey confirms the widespread understanding that sustainable corporate practices are not only critical to the health of the planet, but also make good business sense.\nThe survey was authored by Newsweek and underwritten in part by Kaiser Permanente, where Dr. Telles serves on the board. It is based on an anonymous survey of more than 300 senior executives from companies around the world with annual earnings of more than $500 million. Among the top findings:\n\nNearly three-quarters (72%) of companies surveyed indicated that climate change has impacted their supply chains.\nTwo-thirds (66%) have experienced climate-related disruptions to their own operations in the past year.\nOf the three-quarters of companies with "net zero" carbon emissions goals, more than 8 in 10 (82%) expect to receive a return on their investments to accomplish that goal within an average of 6 years.\nRenewable energy investments top the list of the actions being taken to meet "net-zero" goals, with 82% of companies calling those their top priority. Businesses are increasingly investing directly in new energy through power purchase agreements with renewable and alternative power producers.\nExtending the reach of this approach, more than 60% of businesses said they also plan to require their major suppliers to invest in renewable energy.\n\n"While the ongoing and increasingly harmful effects of climate change are deeply distressing, the concrete and creative actions being taken by businesses around the world can give us a bit of hope that we are not giving up the fight," said Dr. Telles. "I\'m encouraged by this survey and proud of the work that Kaiser Permanente has been doing for more than a decade to achieve net zero carbon emissions."\nDr. Telles notes that Kaiser Permanente is well on its way to achieving its goal of being carbon neutral in 2020. The health care organization announced some of its key actions at the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco last fall, where it identified climate change as an urgent health issue.\nThe businesses included in the survey came from manufacturing, consumer goods, technology, food and agriculture, transportation, and health care sectors.

The opinions expressed are his own.By John FoleyHONG KONG, Oct 18 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Canadas political climate now threatens actual atmospheric conditions. Although Prime Minister Justin Trudeaus carbon tax will probably endure even if his Liberal Party loses the upcoming election, the countrys governmental green wave could be reaching its limits.Trudeaus federal climate levy wasnt the centerpiece of his 2015 leadership bid, but it is his most visible legacy. It slaps a price of $15 on each tonne of carbon, a figure set to rise to $38 by 2022. One of the worlds most comprehensive schemes, it applies to any province that didnt already have a similar policy.It is flawed, though. Even $38 a tonne is less than needed to cut Canadas net emissions by 30% between 2005 and 2030; it pales next to similar plans in many European countries; and it falls short of the World Banks global warming containment projections. Yet Trudeaus government has vacillated over whether it plans to raise the levy, and the Conservatives want to scrap it.Any rollback is unlikely. Polls suggest neither of the two lead parties will win a majority, and influential smaller ones favor carbon pricing. But increasing the tax to an effective level also looks implausible.First, Canadians probably wont swallow higher charges, if electorates elsewhere are any guide. Australians in May rejected the climate-focused Labor party. Washington State residents last year voted against what would have been the first U.S. fee on carbon emissions.Second, Canada is already at risk of so-called carbon leakage, where investment and emissions simply move elsewhere. American intransigence on climate makes it easier. While individual states are tackling pollution  Pennsylvania just pledged to join a cap-and-trade program  Republicans in control of the Senate and White House are stuck in the ice age. Ottawa cant afford to enable the arbitrage opportunity.Canadas economy is in good shape even though Trudeau flubbed a 2015 pledge to balance the budget. It is also warming twice as fast as the rest of the world, according to a government report in April. Given those incentives, it would be a shame if four years of progress ends up in the deep freeze.On Twitter https://twitter.com/johnsfoleyCONTEXT NEWS- Canadians are due to vote in a federal election on Oct. 21.

The plan to halt trains was widely opposed by Extinction Rebellion supporters who feared that it would embolden the movement\'s critics and spark a backlash among Londoners.Footage showed protesters unfurling a banner on top of a stationary train carriage at Canning Town before commuters on a crowded platform began hurling insults and pelting one of them with food.The protester then tried to kick away a commuter who clambered onto the carriage. After a brief struggle the protestor was dragged to the platform, where he was swallowed by a crowd of people shoving and shouting before a woman and a member of the Tube staff intervened to restore order."The crowd became hostile very quickly due to wanting to go to work. I sympathise with the aims of Extinction Rebellion but this was an own goal," said Turan Basri, 57, an environmental health manager, who witnessed the incident."Canning Town is a very working class area. Seeing what they perceived to be middle-class protesters preventing working class people from earning a living didn\'t go down well," Basri said.British Transport Police said eight arrests had so far been made at Canning Town and two other stations.Police condemned the Extinction Rebellion action, but also expressed concern that members of the public had used "violent behaviour" to detain the train protester.A spokeswoman for prime minister Boris Johnson said the protest caused "unnecessary disruption" and London Mayor Sadiq Khan condemned it.Separately, small Extinction Rebellion groups held protests against the arms trade by glueing or locking themselves to the London offices of defence companies Leonardo UK LDOF.MI, Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N and Britain\'s Supreme Court, the movement said. At least seven people were arrested.Police said on Wednesday 1,642 people had been arrested after action targeting the Treasury, financial institutions and City Airport.  (Full Story)Extinction Rebellion says more than 1,400 of its supporters have also been arrested in 20 cities around the world since Oct. 7, including in New York, Brussels, Melbourne and Toronto.The London protests could affect one of the city\'s maajor transport infrastructure projects.Tim Clark, president of Dubai-based airline Emirates, said the upsurge in climate protests may prevent the construction of a third runway at Heathrow airport."With whats going on in and around this city I sometimes wonder if this is going to get across the final hurdle, even though the government has legislated to do it, Clark told delegates at Airlines 2050, an industry conference held in central London under tight security.A coalition of local councils, residents and environmental groups and the mayor of London is currently pursuing a challenge against the Heathrow expansion through the appeals courts.

The conference will be opened by the Hon. Hajia Alima Mahama, Minister of Local Government and Rural Development of Ghana.\nThe recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on global warming confirms unequivocally that the implementation of the current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) will not be sufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 C. Sub-national actors are key to bridging the gap between national climate targets and the concrete action required on the ground.\nThe Covenant of Mayors for Sub-Sahara Africa (CoM SSA) is an EU funded initiative that supports Sub-Saharan cities and municipalities to develop and implement sustainable climate and energy actions. This year, the CoM SSA is the headline initiative featured at the Climate Chance Summit Africa 2019. CoM SSA is the regional chapter of the Global Covenant of Mayors, the largest coalition of cities committed to local climate and energy action.\n"The direct link that we (mayors) have with our citizens and the impact cities can have on people\'s daily lives make it one of the most relevant levels of action to fight climate change," Mayor of Accra, Mr. Mohammed Adjei Sowah\nLaunched in 2015 at the COP21, the CoM SSA is an initiative shaped by local governments to reflect the importance of climate and energy action at local level while highlighting the context and specificities of the Sub-Saharan region.

It is one of the around 7,000 of Pakistan\'s 7,200 glaciers that meteorological officials say show signs of melting, citing data gathered over the last 50 years.Earlier, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had stopped at an airport in Chitral and been given a traditional feathered mountain hat, similar to one gifted to William\'s mother Princess Diana during her visit to the area in 1991. They were also given an album of photos of Diana during her visit. William highlighted the visit to the glacier and the challenge of climate change, a major theme of their five-day trip, in a speech the previous evening at a reception hosted by the British High Commission at Pakistan\'s national monument in the capital, Islamabad. L3N2703S1Pakistan\'s northern glaciers and those throughout the Hindu Kush and Himalaya region, are an important water store for 250 million people, and another 1.6 billion rely on rivers originating in the mountains, putting many communities at risk  as global temperatures rise."This could lead to a loss of over a third of these vital glaciers in less than a century, with enormous impacts not only on the availability of water, but on agriculture and hydropower generation," William said in his speech.He said he hoped Wednesday\'s visit to Chitral would help the couple better understand the challenges residents were facing first hand. "I hope to learn what more we all can do to help prevent and mitigate this impending global catastrophe."Kate and William later observed damage and emergency response drills in a village in Chitral that had been hit by floods due to glaciers melting. They also vistaed a settlement of the Kalash people, a small indigenous group living in the Chitral region where they met with young people and wore colourful local scarves and headwear while being treated to song and dance.

Safety concerns, soaring costs and technological setbacks have slowed nuclear projects since the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan in March 2011.At the same time, despite governments setting ambitious targets to cut green house gas emissions responsible for global warming, emissions hit a record high in 2018. "This is a result of government failure," Birol told an electricity conference in Paris."There is a growing disconnect between government targets and what is happening in real life, a very dangerous disconnect," said the boss of the IEA, which advises industrialised countries on energy issues. "Im worried about the decline of nuclear in the energy mix if governments dont change their policies," Birol said referring to new capacity and lifespan extensions.Birol said nuclear\'s contribution to Europe\'s energy mix could plunge to just 4% within two decades from 25% currently with huge consequences for both emissions and economies. At the same time, the share of polluting fossil fuels in the global energy mix remains at about 63%, the same level as in the 1990s, Birol said. Renewables also pose a threat to nuclear energy as costs fall and capacity rises, according to the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report published in September.  (Full Story)Faced with increasing protests and calls for action to tackle global warming, Birol said nuclear had a role to play in a power sector responsible for 40% of overall emissions."Governments need to keep the existing nuclear power plants. It is the cheapest solution. It would be a big waste and a pity if we dont keep them," he said.Japan went without nuclear power for almost two years following Fukushima, Germany has since pledged to exit nuclear altogether by 2022 and even France, the world\'s second largest nuclear user, plans to reduce its reliance. France, which depends on nuclear power for more than 75% of its electricity, aims to cut that to 50% by 2035 while boosting renewables.In the United States, the world\'s largest nuclear market, operator Tennessee Valley Authority plans to extend the lifespan of its existing nuclear fleet by 20 years and develop new nuclear capacity, CEO Jeff Lyash told the electricity conference in Paris.

The report found that progress has been made in reducing hunger, but hard-won gains are now being threatened, and severe hunger persists in many regions, in part as a result of climate change  the theme of this year\'s GHI. It calls for large-scale action and radical transformation to address the interlinked challenges of hunger and climate change.\nConcern Worldwide U.S. CEO Colleen Kelly said, "The 2019 GHI shows that the UN Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger by 2030 is under threat, and climate change is one of the primary causes." She continued, "Hunger stubbornly persists in many countries and is actually increasing in others. Multiple countries have higher hunger levels now than in 2010, and approximately 45 countries are set to fail to achieve low levels of hunger by 2030. Not only is hunger increasing, but many of these countries are also worst affected by climate change. This is completely unacceptable  and preventable."\nIn her foreword to the GHI, former President of Ireland Mary Robinson said the report provided a timely illustration of how climate breakdown disrupts food systems "jeopardizing one of the most fundamental rights we all share as human beings  the right to adequate and sufficient food."\nNoting that the greatest impacts of climate change fall on those least responsible for it, she continued, "With the number of hungry people risingwe can no longer afford to regard the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Climate Agreement as voluntaryInstead, the full implementation of both has become imperative in order to secure a liveable world for our children and grandchildren. This requires a change of mind-set at the global political level."\nClimate change is affecting the global food system in ways that increase the threats to those who currently already suffer from hunger and undernutrition. Since the early 1990s, the number of extreme weather-related disasters, such as storms, droughts, fires and floods, have doubled, reducing yields of major crops, contributing to food price hikes and income losses\nOn a global level, the prevalence of undernourishment, the percentage of the population without regular access to adequate calories, has stagnated since 2015, and the absolute number of people who are undernourished has actually risen from 785 million in 2015 to 822 million in 2018. The rise was greatest in countries in Africa South of the Sahara affected by conflict and drought. \nOf the 117 countries ranked as part of the GHI, 43 have \'serious\' levels of hunger. One country, the Central African Republic, suffers from a level of hunger that is \'extremely alarming\' (the highest level on the GHI scale), while four countries--Chad, Madagascar, Yemen, and Zambia--suffer from levels of hunger that are \'alarming."\nNine countries have higher scores today than in 2010--Central African Republic (CAR), Madagascar, Venezuela, Yemen, Jordan, Malaysia, Mauritania, Lebanon and Oman.\xa0\nThe report also notes that GHI scores could not be calculated for several countries due to inadequate data. In nine of these countries--Burundi, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Libya, Papua New Guinea, Somalia, South Sudan and Syria--hunger and undernutrition are causes of significant concern. In many of those countries, violent conflict, political unrest, and/or extreme poverty have precipitated food and nutrition insecurity.\nThe GHI includes a number of policy recommendations. These include: prioritizing resilience and adaptation among the most vulnerable groups and regions; better preparation for and response to disasters; the transformation of food systems and addressing of inequalities; action to mitigate climate change without compromising food and nutrition security; and the commitment to fair financing.\nTo read the 2019 Global Hunger Index report, click HERE.\nTo download a graphic of the report\'s highlights, click HERE.\nTo download a map of the 2019 Global Hunger Index by severity, click HERE.\nABOUT CONCERN WORLDWIDE U.S.Concern Worldwide U.S.\xa0is a non-governmental, international humanitarian organization dedicated to reducing suffering and working toward the ultimate elimination of extreme poverty.

Concern Worldwide and German aid agency Welthungerhilfe, co-publisher of the index, said there was a strong correlation between high hunger scores and vulnerability to climate change.The report said the number of extreme weather-related disasters had doubled since the early 1990s, reducing crop yields and contributing to food price hikes.The index is based on four indicators: undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting and child mortality.Nine countries of concern were omitted due to lack of data, including Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia, South Sudan and Syria.The report called for more ambitious action to reduce climate change risks to food security as well as improving disaster preparation and response, and transforming food production and consumption, especially in high-income countries.

"I\'m doing this for your children."Invoking the example of women\'s suffrage activist Emmeline Pankhurst, Bradbrook tried to smash one of the ministry\'s windows with a hammer and screwdriver before she was brought down by a police climber in a cherry-picker and arrested.The group, which uses civil disobedience to highlight the risks posed by climate change and the accelerating loss of plant and animal species, has staged a fresh wave of protest actions in cities from Amsterdam to Melbourne since October 7.In New York, activists glued themselves to a green sailboat parked in Broadway last week to highlight rising sea levels. In Brussels, police used water cannon on Saturday to disperse hundreds of Extinction Rebellion activists gathered in a square. Police ordered a halt to all of the group\'s protests in London on Monday, saying those who did not comply would be arrested. They have already made around 1,500 arrests over the past eight days, including more than 90 at a day of actions in the British capital\'s financial district on Monday. More than 1,400 people have been arrested in 20 cities in other countries, Extinction Rebellion said.The British government reinforced the police call on it to stop. "While we share peoples concerns about global warming, and respect the right to peaceful protest, it should not disrupt peoples day-to-day lives," a government spokeswoman said.The activists oppose plans to run the HS2 rail project through ancient woodlands. The ministry says the rail line will slash journey times between central and northern England and the capital and be much more efficient in carbon terms than driving.The project is billions of pounds over budget and running late and an independent review is considering whether it should go ahead.An activist who tried to lock herself to the ministry said the project would be a "scar across the belly of this land" destroying vital habitats for barn owls, bees and birds."Everybody who is not paying attention is numb at the moment. We all use tactics to numb ourselves because this is scary," said the woman, who gave her name as April, before she was taken away in a police van.Later, police began arresting Extinction Rebellion activists who had assembled to block a road running past the headquarters of the MI5 security service to highlight the risks climate change poses to food security, a Reuters witness said."A significant policing operation continues and we will take robust action against anyone engaged in unlawful protests at locations targeted by Extinction Rebellion," London police\'s Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said.Extinction Rebellion said HS2 would damage or destroy 108 ancient woodlands in the largest single act of deforestation in Britain since World War One.The transport ministry said 7 million new trees and shrubs, including over 40 native species specific to each location will be planted as part of the programme.Supporters say HS2 would give Britain the kind of fast rail services enjoyed by other major countries. Current estimates predict it will cost around 88 billion pounds ($111.5 billion).

Police said they arrested more than 90 people.The arrestees included Rabbi Jeffrey Newman of the Finchley Reform Synagogue, who was arrested near the Bank of England praying, singing and wearing a prayer shawl for the first day of the Jewish festival Sukkot, Extinction Rebellion said.     "The City of London is a preeminent nexus of power in the global system that is killing our world," said Carolina Rosa, spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion.BlackRock declined to comment.Police later ordered a halt to all assembly linked to   Extinction Rebellion in London. At Trafalgar Square in the heart of the city, where demonstrators have pitched camp for the past week amid fountains at the base of Nelson\'s Column, protesters began removing tents. Police made no immediate move to shut down another main protest camp in the district of Vauxhall."Officers have begun the process of clearing Trafalgar Square and getting things back to normal," said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor.Extinction Rebellion said it had left Trafalgar Square but would continue actions in London and cities around the world."The Climate and Ecological Emergency isn\'t going away and we remain resolute in facing it. We urge the Government and the authorities to join us in doing the same," the group said in a statement. "This is bigger than all of us." Extinction Rebellion wants to cause enough disruption to force governments to rapidly cut carbon emissions and reverse the collapse of ecosystems to avert the worst of the devastation scientists project if business as usual continues.  (Full Story)Critics say the group is proposing what amounts to the overthrow of capitalism without any clear idea of what would follow, and that the world needs fossil fuels.Extinction Rebellion said that more than 1,400 people had been arrested in London since it launched its latest actions a week ago. A similar number has in total been arrested in 20 cities in countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.        "CRIMINAL DAMAGE"While activists have long targeted fossil fuel companies, a growing global climate protest movement is increasingly scrutinising the role fund managers, banks and insurance companies play in enabling oil and gas extraction.Emily Grossman, a British science broadcaster who has a PhD in molecular biology, who joined the protest outside BlackRock, said that financing fossil fuel projects was undermining the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming. "This is criminal damage that they are doing to our lives and to the lives of our children and it has to stop," said Grossman, who was later led away by police.  Major oil companies have approved $50 billion of projects since last year that run contrary to the goals of the Paris Agreement, according to an analysis published last month by financial think-tank Carbon Tracker.  (Full Story)Fossil fuel companies say they need to invest in new projects to meet future demand for energy, particularly in fast-growing regions such as Asia.Climate protesters want to pressure index fund firms such as BlackRock because the sector, which now controls half the U.S. stock mutual fund market, has enormous power to influence companies in which they invest trillions of dollars.The leading U.S. index fund firms, BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp, rarely use that clout, a Reuters analysis of their shareholder-voting records found this month.

"That I think is at the top of the list for reasons we need more liquidity." The other reason, he said, is post-financial-crisis regulation that forces banks to hold more reserves.

"We\'re here today to demand that the BBC respond to the emergency in the way they responded to World War Two i.e. devoting the entire professional management structure to getting the message out to the British public," spokesman Donnachadh McCarthy told Reuters.

Moreover, for Chilean utilities, issuing green bonds\r\nwith a hybrid structure may provide an additional funding source while fully or\r\npartially mitigating leveraging effects as they transition from coal-based to\r\nmore renewable-based energy sources.AES Gener issued USD450 million 6.35% junior subordinated hybrid green notes due\r\nin 2079 earlier this month. The hybrid green bond was rated by Fitch and was\r\nstrongly received. Although other companies in the region have issued green\r\nbonds, this was the first one with a hybrid structure with cumulative interest\r\ndeferability and a very long dated maturity. Hybrid green bonds can help\r\ncompanies finance renewable solar, wind and hydroelectric energy projects that\r\nbenefit the environment due to lower emissions that cause global warming, while\r\nhelping Chile meet its decarbonization goals. AES Gener expects to use a portion\r\nof the proceeds to partially refinance debt and fund its acquisition of the\r\n110MW Los Cururos wind farm.Fitch\'s hybrid rating criteria assigns 0%, 50% or 100% equity credit, depending\r\non the structure of hybrid instruments. Fitch\'s ESG scores range from 1 to 5\r\nbased on relevance to a company\'s credit profile. AES Gener has exposure to\r\nemissions regulatory risk, which in combination with other factors, affects its\r\nrating. Therefore, Fitch\'s Rating Navigator for AES Gener assigns a score of 4\r\nto the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air quality sub-factor.Fitch believes other Chilean electric companies may consider issuing hybrid\r\ngreen bonds to help finance renewable energy projects as the country is highly\r\nfocused on decarbonization of its generation capacity. In June, the Chilean\r\ngovernment announced a schedule for decommissioning old, fossil-fuel electrical\r\npower plants. After 2024, working roundtables will be established every five\r\nyears to create new decommissioning schedules. AES Gener, Enel Generacion Chile,\r\nColbun and Engie Energia\xa0Chile all have non-binding agreements with the\r\ngovernment to phase out coal generation by 2040, with a fully decarbonized\r\nenergy matrix, and to make Chile carbon-neutral by 2050.AES Gener has an ambitious decarbonization strategy but, given its leverage\r\nprofile, the company has limited room to execute the strategy without affecting\r\nleverage. We believe this may have motivated the hybrid issuance, for which\r\nFitch assigned 50% equity credit. AES Gener plans to incorporate renewable\r\nenergy sources in new long-term purchase power agreements (PPAs) and to\r\nconstruct 290MW from wind and solar in 2019, on top of the 531MW, hydropower\r\nplant, Alto Maipo, already under construction.Approximately 75% of AES Gener\'s installed capacity in Chile, excluding Cochrane\r\nand Angamos, is coal-fired compared to 58% for Engie in December 2018 and less\r\nthan 10% for Enel and Colbun. Engie has a stronger capital structure than AES\r\nGener, which should afford it more capacity to finance its shift toward more\r\nrenewables-based energy. AES Gener\'s gross leverage of approximately 4.0x is\r\nmoderately high for the rating category and compares unfavorably to the mid-2.0x\r\nrange for Engie and Colburn and less than 2.0x for Enel. We expect Chile\'s\r\ndecarbonization goals to be neutral for Enel and Colbun due to low exposure to\r\ncoal and generation assets more concentrated in hydroelectric, renewables and\r\nnatural gas.The decarbonization calendar establishes that Units 1 and 2 from AES Gener\'s\r\nVentanas complex, which has 322MW of installed capacity, might be decommissioned\r\nin 2024. Remaining units might be decommissioned by December 2040. Fitch does\r\nnot expect material implications for AES Gener\'s cash flow from this\r\ndecommissioning as no long-term PPA\'s are believed to be linked to these units. b Your opinion matters and we would greatly appreciate any constructive\r\nfeedback you have on Fitch Wire commentary.

AES Gener expects to use a portion\r\nof the proceeds to partially refinance debt and fund its acquisition of the\r\n110MW Los Cururos wind farm.Fitch\'s hybrid rating criteria assigns 0%, 50% or 100% equity credit, depending\r\non the structure of hybrid instruments. Fitch\'s ESG scores range from 1 to 5\r\nbased on relevance to a company\'s credit profile. AES Gener has exposure to\r\nemissions regulatory risk, which in combination with other factors, affects its\r\nrating. Therefore, Fitch\'s Rating Navigator for AES Gener assigns a score of 4\r\nto the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air quality sub-factor.Fitch believes other Chilean electric companies may consider issuing hybrid\r\ngreen bonds to help finance renewable energy projects as the country is highly\r\nfocused on decarbonization of its generation capacity. In June, the Chilean\r\ngovernment announced a schedule for decommissioning old, fossil-fuel electrical\r\npower plants. After 2024, working roundtables will be established every five\r\nyears to create new decommissioning schedules. AES Gener, Enel Generacion Chile,\r\nColbun and Engie Energia\xa0Chile all have non-binding agreements with the\r\ngovernment to phase out coal generation by 2040, with a fully decarbonized\r\nenergy matrix, and to make Chile carbon-neutral by 2050.AES Gener has an ambitious decarbonization strategy but, given its leverage\r\nprofile, the company has limited room to execute the strategy without affecting\r\nleverage. We believe this may have motivated the hybrid issuance, for which\r\nFitch assigned 50% equity credit. AES Gener plans to incorporate renewable\r\nenergy sources in new long-term purchase power agreements (PPAs) and to\r\nconstruct 290MW from wind and solar in 2019, on top of the 531MW, hydropower\r\nplant, Alto Maipo, already under construction.Approximately 75% of AES Gener\'s installed capacity in Chile, excluding Cochrane\r\nand Angamos, is coal-fired compared to 58% for Engie in December 2018 and less\r\nthan 10% for Enel and Colbun. Engie has a stronger capital structure than AES\r\nGener, which should afford it more capacity to finance its shift toward more\r\nrenewables-based energy. AES Gener\'s gross leverage of approximately 4.0x is\r\nmoderately high for the rating category and compares unfavorably to the mid-2.0x\r\nrange for Engie and Colburn and less than 2.0x for Enel. We expect Chile\'s\r\ndecarbonization goals to be neutral for Enel and Colbun due to low exposure to\r\ncoal and generation assets more concentrated in hydroelectric, renewables and\r\nnatural gas.The decarbonization calendar establishes that Units 1 and 2 from AES Gener\'s\r\nVentanas complex, which has 322MW of installed capacity, might be decommissioned\r\nin 2024. Remaining units might be decommissioned by December 2040. Fitch does\r\nnot expect material implications for AES Gener\'s cash flow from this\r\ndecommissioning as no long-term PPA\'s are believed to be linked to these units. b Your opinion matters and we would greatly appreciate any constructive\r\nfeedback you have on Fitch Wire commentary.

Moreover, for Chilean utilities, issuing green bonds\r\nwith a hybrid structure may provide an additional funding source while fully or\r\npartially mitigating leveraging effects as they transition from coal-based to\r\nmore renewable-based energy sources.AES Gener issued USD450 million 6.35% junior subordinated hybrid green notes due\r\nin 2079 earlier this month.

Besides capturing pollution, the plants have helped reduce average temperatures in the city by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and increased biodiversity, providing friendly habitats for animals. ACCRA, Ghana - Since 2016, Accra has been working with more than 600 informal refuse collectors, who used to dump rubbish that was burned at illegal open-air sites, causing pollution. More waste is now being collected, recycled and disposed of safely. KOLKATA, India - Kolkata is planning to have its entire 5,000-strong bus fleet, as well as ferries crossing the Ganges River, run on electricity by 2030. It has bought 80 electric buses and plans to add another 100 next year. LONDON, United Kingdom - London introduced the world\'s first Ultra Low Emission Zone in 2019, requiring all vehicles passing through the city centre to meet strict emissions standards or pay a fee. Within months, the number of more polluting vehicles fell by a third as people were pushed to walk, cycle or use public transport. SAN FRANCISCO, United States - San Francisco\'s CleanPowerSF programme allows residents to get their electricity completely or in large part from renewable sources at competitive rates. The city hopes this will help it achieve a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2025.GUANGZHOU, China - Since 2017, Guangzhou has invested $2.1 billion to convert its entire fleet of 11,220 buses to run on electricity and installed some 4,000 charging stations to power them. This has reduced air pollution and noise as well as the city\'s transport system operational costs.SEOUL, South Korea - Seoul has subsidised the installation of solar panels on balconies and rooftops of 1 million homes since 2017, as well as city buildings like schools and parking lots. The city hopes to produce up to 1 GW of solar energy - equal to that generated by a nuclear reactor - by 2022.Sources: C40, Transport for London, Thomson Reuters Foundation (Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Katy Migiro.

The C40 World Mayors Summit in Copenhagen gathered leaders of 94 world cities that are home to more than 700 million people and represent one quarter of the global economy. Their meeting comes a month after a United Nations study delivered a stark warning to the world: slash emissions or watch cities vanish under rising seas, rivers run dry and marine life collapse.  (Full Story) "The Gulf of Mexico is now at our front door," New Orleans mayor LaToya Contrell told a news conference. "While the sea level is rising, we\'re also sinking, and we are losing a football field every 100 minutes."She later told Reuters it would require "billions of dollars" to not only drain the city on the Mississippi River, but also collect and hold water to keep it from running into the drains immediately.While the government of U.S. President Donald Trump still does "not want to believe in science", Contrell said she had recently seen unprecedented bipartisan support at state level for investment in green infrastructure.  By 2050, over 570 low-lying coastal cities will face projected sea level rises of at least 0.5 metres, which could put over 800 million people at risk from storm surges and other impacts, according to C40.   The U.S. city of Boston is planning to bolster its 47-mile shoreline with walls, lifted parks and rising streets, Mayor Marty Walsh told Reuters. He said 10% of the city\'s total capital spending this year will be investment in climate resilience, with more funding to come from the business community, philanthropic investors and the state.Asked if he expected money from the federal government, he said: "Under this administration in Washington I\'m not confident at all." World leaders will hold a climate summit in Chile in December but some mayors were sceptical about the outcome. "I\'m not very optimistic ... But whatever happens at a national level we still have to do our job at home," said Rafal Tzaskowski, the mayor of Poland\'s capital city Warsaw.

This new data pivots forward and imagines an even more frightening future," Yarnold said. "And, you can use a first-of-its kind web tool to find threatened birds in your zip code, as well as a list of things everyone can do." \nAudubon scientists studied 604 North American bird species using 140 million bird records, including observational data from bird lovers and field biologists across the country. \nAudubon\'s zip code-based tool, the Birds and Climate Visualizer, helps users understand the impacts to birds where they live, making climate change even more local, immediate and, for tens of millions of bird fans, deeply personal. \n"Birds are important indicator species, because if an ecosystem is broken for birds, it is or soon will be for people too," said Brooke Bateman, Ph.D., the senior climate scientist for the National Audubon Society. "When I was a child, my grandmother introduced me to the Common Loons that lived on the lake at my grandparent\'s home in northern Wisconsin. Those loons are what drive my work today and I can\'t imagine them leaving the U.S. entirely in summer but that\'s what we\'re facing if trends continue."\nDr. Bateman and her team also studied climate-related impacts on birds across the lower 48 states, including sea level rise, Great Lakes level changes, urbanization, cropland expansion, drought, extreme spring heat, fire weather and heavy rain. \n"We already know what we need to do to reduce global warming, and we already have a lot of the tools we need to take those steps. Now, what we need are more people committed to making sure those solutions are put into practice," said Renee Stone, vice president of climate for the National Audubon Society. "Our elected officials at every level of government must hear from their constituents that this is a priority. Audubon is committed to protecting the places birds need now and in the future and taking action to address the root causes of climate change." \nAudubon has outlined five key steps: \nReduce your use of energy at home and ask your elected officials to support energy-saving policies that reduce the overall demand for electricity and that save consumers money. Ask your elected officials to expand consumer-driven clean energy development that grows jobs in your community  like solar or wind power. Reduce the amount of carbon pollution released into the atmosphere. In order to drive down carbon emissions, we will need innovative economy-wide solutions that address every sector of the economy  like a fee on carbon. Another option is to address carbon emissions one sector at a time like setting a clean energy standard for electricity generation. Advocate for natural solutions, from increasing wetlands along coasts and rivers that absorb soaking rains to protecting forests and grasslands that are homes to birds and serve as carbon storage banks, and putting native plants everywhere to help birds adapt to climate change. Ask elected leaders to be climate and conservation champions. Enter your zip code into Audubon\'s Birds and Climate Visualizer to see how climate change will impact your birds, your community, and the ways you can help.\nAudubon\'s report is based on the 2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report models for 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 degrees C of global warming. At the highest warming scenario of 3.0 C, 305 bird species face three or more climate-related impacts. \nLast month, Science published a study by a joint team of conservation biologists describing a grim picture: a steady decline of nearly three billion North American birds since 1970, primarily as a result of human activities. Climate change will further exacerbate the challenges birds are already facing from human activity. \nIn 2014, Audubon published its first Birds and Climate Change Report. The study showed that more than half of the bird species in North America could lose at least half of their current ranges by 2080 due to rising temperatures. Audubon\'s new findings reflect an expanded and more precise data set, and indicate the dire situation for birds and the places they need will continue.\nAbout AudubonThe National Audubon Society protects birds and the places they need, today and tomorrow.

Bristol city council invested 5 million pounds in CityFunds, an example of \'impact investing,\' a multi-billion dollar movement which pursues social and environmental outcomes and financial returns.Rather than focusing on a single issue, CityFunds invests in local companies that work towards achieving the south-western city\'s four socio-economic priorities, from equal access to housing to greening transport.Big Society Capital, a social investment firm, also invested in the fund which backs projects including a wind turbine built by residents to power deprived communities.Bristol is one of more than a dozen cities including New York, Buenos Aires and Taipei that in September announced plans to fight global warming and pledged to report their progress to the United Nations.  (Full Story)  Bristol\'s mayor, Marvin Rees, said in a statement the fund would transform the city, which suffers from inequality, and could be a "step towards delivering inclusive and sustainable growth."The idea for CityFunds was partly inspired by similar projects in American cities like Chicago which have worked with business to tackle poverty, said Anna Shiel of Big Society Capital.The "scale, longevity, and inclusivity" makes this fund unique, said Shiel, adding the model could be replicated across the country.So-called social entrepreneurs face scrutiny from investors over their ability to deliver social and environmental impact as well as profit.  (Full Story)A challenge is seeking out investments that "truly reach the most underserved people," said Amanda Feldman of the Impact Management Project.

The Orkney Islands, situated off the north coast of the Scottish mainland, are home to more than 3,000 historical sites.Evidence has been found of human habitation there going back 8,500 years. Some buildings on the islands date to the Iron Age, Viking rule and medieval times.But around 1,000 sites are situated on the coastline and are under threat.One such site is the Iron Age building South Howe Broch on the island of Rousay. Dating from between 600-400AD, the sea has taken much of the site\'s western area. Now the broch wall itself is falling into the sea.Julie Gibson, a lecturer at the University of the Highlands and Islands, says it will eventually disappear."What you can see just over here is the front door of the broch, exposed by the sea, taking away parts of the ruins and leaving a built wall still intact. And each year a little more falls as the sea batters it," she said as she stood on the cliff\'s edge."What we have discovered in recent years, through the use of geophysics and other things, is that... on this stretch of the coastline, all the settlement archaeology is within 100 metres of the coast edge. And so as the sea takes this heritage of ours away it\'s taking all that we have," she said.  A couple of hundred metres north of South Howe Broch is Midhowe Broch. This Iron Age building is well-preserved, courtesy of a sea wall built in the 1930s and well-maintained since. A spring-fed water tank, fireplace and room partitions are clearly visible. But even Midhowe Broch is at risk from climate change.A climate risk assessment of Orkney\'s Neolithic sites, published by conservation public body Historic Environment Scotland (HES) in July this year, described the potential impact of climate change on the sites as "extreme" and their vulnerability as "high".According to HES, average precipitation (rain, sleet and snow) has increased by 27% in Scotland since the early 1960s. In the same period, winter precipitation has gone up by more than 70% in parts of northern Scotland.Wetter weather means buildings are wetter for longer, meaning water is more likely to penetrate masonry and decay it. It also leads to metal parts of buildings corroding and the ground becoming unstable. This can lead to structural collapse.  Sea levels are also rising and beach erosion is a growing problem.  Since 1970 some Orkney beaches have narrowed by an average of 16 inches (40 centimetres) per year since 1970. That is compared to an annual average loss of eight inches between 1890 and 1970, according to data from cross-governmental coastal change assessment partnership Dynamic Coast.Increased storminess also threatens damaging Orkney\'s historical sites, HES says.  Arguably the most famous site of Orkney is Skara Brae. This Neolithic settlement, occupied from roughly 3100-2500BC, features a network of stone buildings. When inhabited it was approximately one kilometre (0.6 miles) from the sea with a freshwater loch and sand dunes in between. Now it sits only a few metres from the North Atlantic.Visitors can see the settlement\'s 5,000-year-old hearths, bed recesses, cupboards and dressers. Some 112,000 people visited it in 2018."Climate change is a really real present risk. The climate has already changed because of the influence of humans. And it\'s going to continue to change and that pace of change is going to speed up," said HES climate change scientist, David Harkin."So the risk to sites like Skara Brae and other sites around Orkney, it\'s real, it\'s here, it\'s happening. But it shouldn\'t all be doom and gloom and despair. There is an opportunity to still do something about it and to avoid the worst possible consequences of climate change," he added.

The rare times when water does trickle from the spout, it is reason to celebrate."Sometimes we do not get water for so many weeks - if we get water, we welcome it by dancing," said Tewdros, 32, with a sad smile.Like many of his neighbours in the Kirkos district of Addis Ababa, and like thousands of others living in the city, Tewdros has struggled to secure a regular supply of clean water in his home for at least 10 years.Ethiopia is the source of up to 80% of the River Nile\'s water. But getting enough potable water to everyone in the country who needs it is a challenge, water experts and officials say.The capital has long suffered with water shortages, the result of an aging and limited water supply system, lack of water storage and a rapidly growing population.Environmental experts warn that climate change will only make matters worse in the future. Hoping to ease the shortage, the Addis Ababa government has embarked on a series of development projects aimed at pumping storing, cleaning and delivering more groundwater.The latest, the Legedadi Phase II Water Project, launched in April, aims to supply the city with an additional 86,000 cubic metres of clean water per day.That would help boost the area of the city receiving regular water supply from 60% to 66%, according to Nigusse Desalegn, spokesman for the Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority (AAWSA). The government also plans to install additional groundwater infrastructure that would supply the city with another 130,000 cubic metres of clean water a day, Nigusse said."We believe (these projects) will play a significant role in solving the growing water scarcity problem," he said.GROWING DEMANDCurrently, the dams, reservoirs and wells that constitute the Addis Ababa water supply system provide less than two-thirds of the 930,000 cubic metres of potable water residents need every day, according to the AAWSA.Nigusse pointed to Ethiopia\'s steady economic growth, and its rising population, as factors in Addis Ababa\'s clean water shortage.The city\'s water demands have almost doubled in the past five years, he said, and that demand is rising every day as the capital expands both out and up, with a boom in the construction of apartment blocks and offices, Nigusse said.Bisrat Kifle, a researcher and associate professor at Ethiopian Civil Service University, said the problem will get worse as extreme weather events such as flooding and drought become more common.Research by Bisrat and his colleagues published in 2017 estimated that by 2039 Addis Ababa\'s current population of more than 3.5 million will reach 7 million.As that happens, water scarcity could heighten "as a result of complex interaction of urbanisation and climate change", it noted.The capital already experiences bouts of heavy rainfall and  "we project rainfall will increase and the effect will be siltation (of reservoirs) due to flooding," Bisrat said.When soil washes into reservoirs, it leaves less room for storing water. As a result, he said, Addis Ababa and some of its suburbs could be facing an additional clean water shortfall of up to 380 million cubic meters per year. The health consequences of lack of water can be dire, health experts say.Among Ethiopia\'s population of more than 100 million, about 42 million people do not have access to safe drinking water, according to the Barcelona-based We Are Water Foundation.Each year, 8,500 children under the age of five die due to diseases caused by contaminated water, according to the foundation.CHALLENGESThe state-funded Legedadi Stage II Water Project, estimated to cost up to 4 billion birr ($137 million), according to government figures, is due to be completed by 2021.It will include 15 new reservoirs to store pumped groundwater and 176 kilometres (109 miles) of pipelines to deliver it, according to AAWSA data.  For now, a share of Addis Ababa residents say they have to resort to buying water for everything from drinking to cooking to washing.Tewdros in Kirkos said people routinely queued for up to 10 hours to get water from roadside vendors and water tank trucks."We carry jerry cans and travel far away and buy 10 litres of water for 2 birr ($0.068) which will even be used just for hygiene," he said, adding that he hoped the government would come through with a solution.Nigusse told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the government\'s efforts to get potable water to everyone in the city are hampered in part by a system of leaky pipes and by the city\'s sometimes erratic energy supply.A study by the Addis Ababa Institute of Technology published in 2012 showed that more than a third of the water running through the capital\'s pipes leaked out before getting to residents.Unseasonable dry spells, linked to climate change, also are having an impact on the water supply, Nigusse added.Almost all of the electricity distributed through the country\'s power grid comes from hydropower, according to the World Bank.When the country gets less rainfall than expected and dam levels drop, so does the power supply - which, in turn, makes it difficult for the government to get enough clean water to everyone, including those in the capital."There are recurrent power shortages, so it is difficult to pump water from the ground" into the reservoirs, Nigusse said.For Bisrat, the answer lies not in building more reservoirs, but in making more efficient water use and water conservation a priority for households and businesses.He recommended the government introduce a seasonal tariff - charging people more for water during drought - and impose financial penalties when consumption exceeds a reasonable amount."We have to know how to use our resources as a metropolitan city and think about climate change and water scarcity in every decision," Bisrat said.
