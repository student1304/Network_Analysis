Mosquitoes 
are 
of 
great 
medical 
significance 
as 
vectors 
of 
deadly 
diseases. 
Despite 
this, 
little 
is 
known 
about 
their 
evolutionary 
history 
or 
how 
their 
present 
day 
diversity 
has 
been 
shaped. 
Within 
a 
phylogenetic 
framework, 
here 
we 
show 
a 
strong 
correlation 
between 
climate 
change 
and 
mosquito 
speciation 
rates: 
the 
first 
time 
to 
our 
knowledge 
such 
an 
effect 
has 
been 
demonstrated 
for 
insects. 
Information 
theory 
reveals 
that 
although 
climate 
change 
is 
correlated 
with 
mosquito 
evolution 
there 
are 
other 
important 
factors 
at 
play. 
We 
identify 
one 
such 
driver 
to 
be 
the 
rise 
of 
mammals, 
which 
are 
predominant 
hosts 
of 
Culicidae. 
Regardless 
of 
the 
precise 
mechanism, 
we 
demonstrate 
a 
strong 
historical 
association. 
This 
finding, 
taken 
in 
combination 
with 
projected 
rises 
in 
atmospheric 
CO2 
from 
anthropogenic 
activity, 
has 
important 
implications 
for 
culicid 
vector 
distributions 
and 
abundance, 
and 
consequently 
for 
human 
health.

T
T
he 
adverse 
effects 
of 
climate 
change 
upon 
global 
biodiversity 
are 
of 
increasing 
concern. 
Global 
warming 
is 
known 
to 
affect 
the 
diversity, 
abundance 
and 
distribution 
of 
animal 
and 
plant 
species1, 
but 
organisms 
respond 
in 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
ways 
depending 
upon 
their 
ecology, 
physiology 
and 
life 
history. 
Similarly, 
elevated 
levels 
of 
CO2 
may 
have 
effects 
on 
plants 
over 
and 
above 
those 
mediated 
by 
greenhouse 
warming2. 
Surprisingly, 
given 
the 
singular 
contribution 
of 
insects 
to 
global 
diversity, 
there 
have 
been 
few 
studies 
of 
the 
effects 
of 
temperature, 
and 
no 
direct 
studies 
of 
the 
effects 
of 
atmospheric 
CO2 
levels 
on 
their 
species 
richness 
or 
rate 
of 
diversification3. 


Mosquitoes 
(Diptera, 
Culicidae) 
include 
many 
of 
the 
most 
problematic 
insect 
pests, 
and 
are 
of 
particular 
medical 
significance. 
The 
adult 
females 
of 
many 
species 
require 
a 
blood 
meal 
from 
a 
vertebrate, 
which 
is 
located 
using 
CO24 
and 
other 
chemical 
cues, 
before 
producing 
eggs5. 
Mosquitoes 
vector 
filarial 
nematodes, 
a 
variety 
of 
bacterial 
infections 
(including 
tularaemia) 
and 
numerous 
viral 
diseases 
(including 
zika, 
yellow 
fever, 
dengue 
fever, 
chikungunya, 
West 
Nile 
virus 
and 
other 
arboviruses)6. 
Specially, 
Malaria, 
which 
is 
caused 
by 
species 
of 
the 
alveolate 
Plasmodium, 
is 
only 
vectored 
to 
humans 
by 
Anopheles, 
a 
genus 
of 
Culicidae6,7. 
Effective 
treatments 
are 
lacking 
for 
many 
of 
these 
infections. 
An 
estimated 
one 
million 
people 
die 
each 
year 
as 
a 
result 
of 
pathogens 
transmitted 
via 
these 
bites7. 


Mosquitoes 
have 
extremely 
wide 
environmental 
tolerances 
and 
a 
nearly 
ubiquitous 
geographical 
distribution, 
being 
present 
on 
all 
major 
landmasses 
except 
Antarctica 
and 
Iceland. 
Nevertheless, 
changes 
in 
climate 
and 
land 
use 
on 
ecological 
timescales 
can 
variously 
expand 
or 
fragment 
their 
distribution 
patterns8, 
raising 
consequent 
concerns 
for 
human 
health. 
Here 
we 
ask 
whether 
such 
ecological 
responses 
leave 
a 
signature 
in 
the 
pattern 
of 
clade 
diversification 
throughout 
the 
deep 
time 
history 
of 
the 
group. 
In 
particular, 
we 
investigate 
speciation 
as 
a 
potential 
correlate 
of 
both 
global 
mean 
temperature 
and 
atmospheric 
CO2 
concentration 
over 
the 
last 
195 
million 
years. 
We 
also 
attempt 
to 
identify 
the 
mechanism 
by 
which 
climate 
change 
has 
driven 
speciation 
in 
mosquitoes. 


Diversification 
through 
time 
is 
often 
quantified 
using 
simple 
taxonomic 
methods. 
Species 
(or 
higher 
taxa 
as 
proxies) 
are 
treated 
as 
independent 
units 
of 
diversity, 
and 
their 
numbers 
are 
tallied 
within 
successive 
time 
bins9. 
Such 
approaches 
have 
been 
used 
very 
effectively 
when 
testing 
the 
correlation 
between 
climate 
and 
biological 
diversification 
for 
predominantly 
extinct 
groups 
with 
a 
rich 
fossil 
record10. 
Mosquitoes, 
by 
contrast, 
have 
a 
rich 
extant 
diversity 
but 
a 
fragmentary 
fossil 
record 
concentrated 
in 
a 
few 
sites 
of 
exceptional 
preservation11. 
In 
such 
cases, 
more 
sophisticated 
phylogenetic 
methods 
can 
be 
implemented 
to 
model 
diversification 
rates 
through 
time 
using 
Bayesian 
inference12,13. 
These 
approaches 
require 
large 
and 
inclusive 
trees, 
which 
are 
not 
always 
available 
for 
the 
most 
speciose 
groups. 
Large 
trees 
can 
be 
inferred 
from 
supermatrices: 
concatenations 
and 
reanalyses 
of 
all 
available 
morphological 
and 
molecular 
character 
data. 
This 
is 
a 
painstaking 
and 
time-consuming 
process. 
Large 
blocks 
of 
missing 
data 
can 
create 
analytical 
problems13 
and 
further 
data 
collection 
may 
ultimately 
be 
necessary14. 
Moreover, 
the 
best 
methods 
for 
analysing 
one 
data 
partition 
may 
not 
be 
optimal 
for 
all15. 
The 
alternative 
and 
usually 
more 
tractable 
approach 
entails 
synthesising 
a 
supertree 
from 
all 
of 
the 
published 
phylogenies 
for 
the 
group. 
This 
is 
most 
often 
achieved 
by 
encoding 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
source 
trees 
using 
group 
inclusion 
characters 
and 
resolving 
conflicts 
using 
parsimony: 
formally, 
Matrix 
Representation 
Parsimony 
(MRP)10,16–18. 
Our 
supertree 
is 
synthesised 
from 
550 
source 
trees 
published 
between 
1981 
and 
2014. 
We 
time-calibrate 
this 
using 
those 
fossil 
dates 
in 
which 
we 
have 
greatest 
confidence, 
enabling 
us 
to 
model 
rates 
of 
speciation 
across 
the 
last 
195 
million 
years. 
We 
demonstrate 
statistically 
how 


these 
rates 
correlated 
with 
changes 
in 
atmospheric 
CO2 
and 
global 
temperature. 
We 
also 
show 
that 
there 
was 
a 
direct 
transfer 
of 
information 
from 
the 
speciation 
of 
mammals 
to 
the 
speciation 
of 
mosquitoes. 
However, 
despite 
significant 
correlation, 
there 
was 
an 
additional 
missing 
driver 
acting 
to 
transfer 
information 
from 
climate 
to 
the 
biota. 


Results 


The 
most 
inclusive 
phylogeny 
of 
mosquitoes. 
Our 
supertree 
includes 
1000 
leaves 
(a 
coincidentally 
round 
number), 
equivalent 
to 
28% 
of 
described 
mosquito 
species 
from 
nearly 
80% 
of 
the 
genera 
identified 
by 
Reinert 
et 
al.19, 
and 
is 
therefore 
the 
most 
inclusive 
phylogeny 
ever 
assembled 
for 
the 
group. 
A 
small 
number 
(about 
1%) 
of 
species 
were 
recovered 
in 
anomalous 
subfamilies, 
but 
this 
phenomenon 
has 
been 
noted 
in 
other 
MRP 
supertrees10,16–18, 
and 
is 
a 
function 
of 
both 
the 
sparsity 
of 
taxon 
sampling 
in 
some 
source 
trees 
and 
the 
degree 
of 
overlap 
between 
them18. 
The 
two 
subfamilies, 
Culicinae 
and 
Anophelinae, 
resolved 
as 
sister 
clades 
(Fig. 
1). 
Relationships 
at 
the 
generic 
and 
deeper 
levels 
were 
broadly 
consistent 
with 
those 
proposed 
by 
Harbach20 
based 
on 
morphological 
characters, 
but 
greatly 
expanded 
upon 
that 
author’s 
taxon 
sample 
(28 
genera 
within 
two 
subfamilies). 
Relationships 
within 
Anophelinae 
were 
well 
resolved 
and 
consistent 
with 
previous 
studies. 
Tribes 
within 
Culicinae 
were 
mostly 
recovered 
as 
clades, 
with 
the 
exceptions 
of 
Aedeomyiini, 
Orthopodomyiini 
and 
Ficalbiini 
(which 
are 
poorly 
sampled: 
Fig. 
1; 
Supplementary 
Fig. 
1). 


Relationships 
within 
the 
traditional 
Aedes 
(Culicinae) 
are 
the 
most 
problematic 
part 
of 
the 
tree, 
and 
were 
the 
subject 
of 
greatest 
controversy 
hitherto19,20,reflecting 
conflicts 
within 
the 
source 
trees. 
Human 
vector 
species 
are 
indicated 
on 
our 
supertree 
(Fig. 
2a, 
b), 
and 
although 
there 
is 
specificity 
of 
pathogens 
to 
vectors 
near 
the 
tips 
of 
the 
phylogeny, 
there 
is 
increasing 
liability 
in 
these 
interactions 
progressively 
deeper 
into 
the 
tree. 
Closely 
related 
vectors 
can 
therefore 
convey 
distantly 
related 
pathogens, 
and 
vice 
versa. 


Divergence 
times. 
The 
two 
constituent 
subfamilies 
of 
Culicidae, 
namely 
Culicinae 
and 
Anophelinae, 
diverged 
around 
195 
mya 
(million 
years 
ago), 
and 
were 
sister 
clades 
in 
our 
supertree. 
Most 
extant 
genera 
diverged 
before 
130 
mya, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
Anopheles 
and 
Ochlerotatus, 
which 
were 
estimated 
to 
have 
first 
appeared 
around 
51 
and 
48 
mya 
respectively. 
These 
originations 
were 
in 
the 
immediate 
wake 
of 
the 
Palaeocene-Eocene 
Thermal 
Maximum 
(PETM) 
56 
mya. 
At 
this 
time 
CO2 
levels 
were 
reequilibrating 
after 
record 
high 
levels, 
but 
both 
ocean 
and 
air 
temperatures 
were 
nonetheless 
elevated21. 
Atmospheric 
CO2 
levels 
are 
currently 
increasing 
at 
their 
fastest 
rate 
since 
the 
PETM22, 
and 
this 
may 
similarly 
stimulate 
rates 
of 
speciation 
across 
the 
group. 


Overall 
shifts 
in 
speciation 
rates. 
Mean 
speciation 
rates 
throughout 
the 
tree 
were 
inferred 
in 
BAMM12 
(9000 
samples 
of 
rate-time 
data 
pairs: 
a 
figure 
determined 
empirically 
from 
previous 
studies10) 
and 
mean 
speciation 
rates 
for 
major 
groups 
have 
been 
illustrated 
through 
time 
(Fig. 
3). 
Overall 
mean 
rates 
of 
speciation 
were 
significantly 
faster 
in 
Anophelinae 
than 
Culicinae. 
There 
were 
also 
three 
major 
rate 
shifts 
across 
the 
entire 
Culicidae: 
one 
just 
before 
194 
mya 
(a 
brief 
and 
transient 
increase), 
a 
second 
at 
194 
mya 
(a 
significant 
decline, 
continuing 
to 
180 
mya) 
and 
a 
third 
between 
30 
and 
24 
mya 
(a 
more 
modest 
acceleration) 
(Figs. 
1 
and 
3a). 
Mean 
speciation 
rates 
within 
the 
entire 
Culicidae 
remained 
low 
between 
180 
and 
30 
mya 
(Fig. 
3a). 
All 
significant 
rate 
shifts 
across 
all 
Culicidae, 
as 
well 
as 
within 
vector 
and 
non-vector 
species 
considered 
in 
isolation, 
are 
tabulated

and 
the

of 
several 
groups 
of 
ruminants24, 
rodents25 
and 
other 
mammal 
clades 
that 
may 
have 
increased 
the 
availability 
of 
host 
species 
(Fig. 
1). 


Our 
speciation 
rate 
analyses 
also 
demonstrated 
more 
rapid 
speciation 
amongst 
vector 
species 
than 
non-vectors, 
and 
rates 
of 
speciation 
in 
Anophelinae 
twice 
as 
fast 
as 
those 
in 
Culicinae 
(Supplementary 
Table 
2). 
In 
response 
to 
recent 
criticisms 
of 
BAMM12,we 
verified 
our 
speciation 
rate 
estimates 
by 
calculating 
diversification 
rates 
for 
Anophelinae 
and 
Culicidae 
using 
a 
fossilised 
birth-death 
model 
based 
on 
molecular 
data 
and 
implemented 
in 
BEAST 
226. 
The 
diversification 
rate 
of 
Anophelinae 
was 
estimated 
at 
0.0553 
lineage 
per 
myr 
(million 
years), 
which 
is 
still 
distinctly 
higher 
than 
the 
diversification 
rate 
of 
Culicidae 
(0.037 
lineage 
per 
myr). 
To 
further 
investigate 
any 
putative 
relationship 
between 
speciation 
rate 
and 
partitions 
of 
our 
data 
(vector/non-vector, 
Anophelinae/
Culicinae), 
phylogenetic 
generalised 
least 
squares 
regression 
tests 
were 
used. 
Speciation 
rate 
was 
significantly 
correlated 
with 
the 
partition 
of 
subfamily 
(p 
< 
0.001), 
but 
not 
with 
the

in 
our 
BAMM 
analyses. 


Speciation 
rates 
increase 
with 
rising 
atmospheric 
CO2, 
and 
with 
rising 
temperature. 
Our 
detrended 
cross-correlation 
analysis 
(DCCA) 
tests27 
demonstrated 
that 
rising 
CO2 
concentration 
correlated 
positively 
and 
very 
significantly 
(p 
< 
2.2e-16 
in 
all 
cases) 
with 
increasing 
rates 
of 
speciation 
across 
the 
Culicidae, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
all 
of 
our 
subgroups 
(Anophelinae 
and 
Culicinae, 
vectors 
and 
non-vectors). 
This 
correlation 
was 
stronger 
for 
the 
non-vectors 
than 
for 
the 
vectors, 
and 
stronger 
for 
the 
Culicinae 
than 
for 
the 
Anophelinae. 
CO2 
is 
a 
potent 
greenhouse 
gas, 
and 
its 
atmospheric 
concentration 
is 
correlated 
with 
mean 
global 
temperatures 
over 
a 
variety 
of 
timescales28. 
Global 
warming 
is 
the 
obvious 
mechanism 
by 
which 
elevated 
CO2 
levels 
might 
cause 
increases 
in 
the 
rate 
of 
speciation, 
but 
our 
results 
are 
equivocal 
in 
this 
regard. 
While 
increasing 
rates 
of 
speciation 
correlate 
significantly 
with 
increasing 
temperature 
(p 
< 
2.2e-16 
in 
all 
cases), 
the 
correlation 
of 
speciation 
with 
CO2 
level 
is 
stronger 
still 
(Table 
1). 
Moreover, 
the 
correlation 
between 
speciation 
rate 
and 
temperature 
is 
stronger 
for 
vectors 
than 
for 
non-vectors, 
and 
stronger 
for 
the 
Culicinae 
than 
for 
the 
Anophelinae. 
Hence, 
at 
least 
some 
of 
the 
effects 
of 
CO2 
must 
be 
mediated 
by 
mechanisms 
other 
than 
greenhouse 
warming.

This

implicating 
one 
or 
more 
additional 
processes29. 
The

from 
mammals 
to 
mosquitoes 
shows 
that 
the 
rise 
of 
mammals 
is 
one 
factor 
underlying 
mosquito 
diversification. 
However, 
the 
precise 
mechanism 
by 
which 
climate

drives 
speciation 
in 
both 
mammals 
and 
mosquitoes 
remains 
unknown.

Discussion 


Climate 
change 
over 
macro-evolutionary 
time 
scales 
has 
long 
been 
known 
to 
drive 
biotic 
turnover30. 
Erwin31 
theorised 
that 
the 
positive 
association 
between 
biodiversity 
and 
global 
temperature 



seen 
at 
the 
spatial 
scale 
(e.g., 
the 
latitudinal 
diversity 
gradient) 
would 
predict 
a 
positive 
relationship 
between 
biodiversity 
and 
global 
temperatures 
through 
time. 
The 
results 
of 
some 
previous 
work 
support 
this32,33, 
whilst 
others 
have 
found 
evidence 
to 
the 
contrary10,34. 
For 
mosquitoes, 
we 
find 
that 
global 
warming 
and 
elevated 
atmospheric 
CO2 
in 
particular 
are 
strongly 
correlated 
with 
increased 
speciation 
rates. 
We 
also 
find 
that 
more 
than 
one 
mechanism 
is 
required 
to 
fully 
explain 
the 
effect 
of 
past 
climate 
change 
on 
biotic 
evolution. 


Our 
finding 
that 
mammal 
speciation 
is 
linked 
to 
mosquito 
speciation 
is 
unsurprising 
given 
that 
mammals 
are 
a 
predominant 
source 
of 
food 
for 
many 
species 
of 
mosquitoes35. 
Anophelinae, 
in 
particular, 
exhibit 
distinctive 
and 
diverse 
behaviours 
and 
a 
high 
degree 
of 
host 
specificity36. 
Anopheles, 
which 
constitutes 
most 
species 
of 
Anophelinae, 
is 
renowned 
for 
feeding 
on 
both 
humans 
and 
domesticated 
animals, 
and 
is 
the 
sole 
vector 
of 
human 
malarial 
parasites. 
The 
speciation 
rate 
in 
Anophelinae 
is 
relatively 
high, 
but 
the 
correlation 
between 
this 
rate 
and 
both 
atmospheric 
CO2 
and 
temperature 
is 
comparatively 
low. 
Hence, 
speciation 
in 
Anophelinae 
may 
also 
have 
been 
driven, 
at 
least 
in 
part, 
by 
its 
relatively 
high 
degree 
of 
host 
specificity 
and 
the 
evolution 
of 
mammals. 


We 
note 
in 
this 
context 
that 
female 
mosquitoes 
in 
search 
of 
a 
blood 
meal 
use 
levels 
of 
CO2 
as 
the 
initial 
cue 
to 
locate 
potential 
human 
or 
animal 
hosts. 
However, 
this 
stimulus 
is 
less 
effective 
as 
the 
ambient 
level 
of 
CO2 
increases, 
since 
the 
differential 
between 
the 
host 
and 
its 
environment 
becomes 
less 
marked37. 
At 
closer 
quarters, 
a 
diversity 
of 
other 
chemical 
cues 
become 
more 
important 
for 
host 
selection, 
including 
lactic 
acid, 
saccharides, 
blood 
group 
and 
other 
antigens, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
variety 
of 
additional 
volatile 
odours38. 
It 
is 
well 
recorded 
that 
some 
people 
are 
more 
prone 
to 
mosquito 
bites 
than 
others, 
though 
the 
mechanisms 
underpinning 
these 
differences 
are 
still 
not 
fully 
understood19,39. 
Similar 
cues 
govern 
host 
specificity, 
although 
many 
species 
of 
mosquitoes 
will 
feed 
on 
a 
diversity 
of 
hosts 
across 
higher 
taxa. 
Other 
mechanisms 
by 
which 
elevated 
CO2 
might 
promote 
speciation 
in 
mosquitoes 
are 
unclear, 
but 
one 
possibility 
is 
that

females 
may 
have 
evolved 
a 
variety 
of 
other 
more 
specific 
mechanisms 
for 
locating 
their 
hosts 
at 
greater 
distances, 
and 
these 
may 
have 
functioned 
as 
potential 
isolating 
mechanisms. 


The 
effects 
of 
elevated 
atmospheric 
CO2 
upon 
mosquito 
development 
are 
not 
well 
understood. 
In 
general 
terms, 
elevated 
CO2 
levels 
are 
known 
to 
have 
detrimental 
effects 
on 
the 
quality 
of 
nutrients 
available 
to 
many 
species 
that 
feed 
upon 
leaf 
litter 
as 
larvae21, 
thereby 
reducing 
rates 
of 
larval 
development. 
By 
contrast, 
raised 
CO2 
may 
have 
indirect 
and 
beneficial 
effects, 
mediated 
by 
its 
influence 
upon 
ambient 
global 
temperatures. 
These 
include 
reduced 
hatching 
times 
and 
increased 
survival 
rates40,41, 
both 
of 
which 
increase 
the 
rate 
of 
transfer 
of 
mosquito-borne 
diseases42,43. 
Elevated 
CO2 
may 
also 
have 
direct 
effects 
on 
the 
dynamics 
of 
interspecific 
and 
intraspecific 
competition 
between 
aquatic 
larvae43, 
changes 
that 
may 
also 
have 
promoted 
speciation. 
Higher 
atmospheric 
CO2 
may 
also 
have 
macro-evolutionary 
effects. 
In 
land 
plants, 
raised 
CO2, 
humidity, 
and 
global 
temperatures 
correlate 
with 
increased 
rates 
of 
diversification44. 
Many 
groups 
of 
insects, 
including 
mosquitoes, 
have 
close 
associations 
with 
plants, 
and 
their 
patterns 
of 
diversification 
are 
broadly 
correlated45,46. 
Elevated 
CO2 
has 
also 
been 
shown 
to 
increase 
the 
diversification 
rate 
of 
large 
mammalian 
herbivores, 
mediated 
via 
its 
effects 
upon 
vegetation. 
Large 
mammals 
are, 
in 
turn, 
predominant 
hosts 
of 
numerous 
mosquito 
species47. 
Therefore, 
there 
are 
a 
number 
of 
plausible 
mechanisms 
that 
could 
link 
global 
warming 
and 
elevated 
atmospheric 
CO2 
to 
increased 
rates 
of 
speciation 
in 
mosquitoes, 
and 
that 
could 
also 
contribute 
to 
the 
missing 
processes 
identified 
in 
our 
analyses. 


Given 
the 
historical 
association 
between 
climate 
change 
and 
the 
rise 
of 
mosquitoes, 
the 
projected 
anthropogenic 
rises 
in 
atmospheric 
CO2 
pressures 
and 
concomitant 
increases 
in 
global 
mean 
temperatures 
appear 
likely 
to 
elevate 
rates 
of 
speciation 
across 
Culicidae. 
This 
may, 
in 
turn, 
increase 
the 
probability 
of 
new 
vector/pathogen 
interactions 
arising, 
particularly 
given 
the 
plasticity 
of 
these 
relationships 
across 
the 
phylogeny. 
This 
effect 
is 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
troubling 
increases 
in 
vector 
distributions 
projected 
for 
most 
climate 
change 
scenarios, 
such 
that 
vectors 
and 
diseases 
are 
likely 
to 
re-establish 
themselves 
in 
regions 
from 
which 
they 
have 
been 
eradicated8,48. 


Methods 
Building 
the 
supertree. 
Potential 
source 
papers 
were 
identified 
using 
the 
Web 
of 
Science. 
We 
used 
the 
following 
search 
terms: 
phylog*, 
taxonom*, 
systematic*, 
and 
clad*, 
coincident 
with 
any 
scientific 
and 
common 
names 
constituent 
within 
the 
Culicidae, 
from 
families 
to 
genera. 
Each 
source 
paper 
was 
inspected 
manually 
for 
one 
or 
more 
phylogenetic 
trees, 
and 
the 
references 
cited 
by 
each 
paper 
were 
similarly 
trawled 
for 
additional 
trees. 
In 
this 
manner, 
we 
collated 
550 
source 
trees 
from 
284 
source 
papers 
published 
up 
to 
the 
end 
of 
July 
2014 
(Supplementary 
References: 
Part 
1). 
Each 
tree 
was 
digitised 
precisely 
in 
its 
published 
form 
using 
Mesquite 
3.11 
49. 
The 
Supertree 
Toolkit 
2 
(STK)50 
was 
used 
to 
standardise 
these 
sources 
and 
to 
produce 
a 
single 
matrix 
representation 
of 
their 
structure 
using 
group 
inclusion 
characters51. 
We 
excluded 
synonyms 
and 
standardised 
species 
names 
using 
the 
mosquito 
taxonomic 
inventory 
website 
(http://mosquitotaxonomic-
inventory.info/). 
The 
protocols 
described 
by 
Davis 
and 
Page18 
were 
followed 
to 
ensure 
the 
independence 
of 
each 
source. 
Outgroup 
taxa 
were 
removed 
from 
the 
entire 
data 
set, 
and 
replaced 
by 
an 
all 
zero 
outgroup. 
The 
resulting 
matrix 
representation 
was 
analysed 
using 
flat-weighted 
maximum 
parsimony 
in 
TNT 
1.5 


. 
The 
analysis 
followed 
Davis 
et 
al.10. 
We 
ran 
multiple 
replications 
at

with

of

and

of 
5321 
steps, 
were 
saved 
and 
summarised 
as 
a 
Maximum 
Agreement 
Subtree 
in 
PAUP*4.0a151 
53. 
The 
resulting 
supertree 
comprised 
1000 
taxa 
(a 
coincidentally 
round 
number) 
within 
103 
genera 
(according 
to 
the 
classification 
of 
Reinert 
et 
al.19). 


Time 
calibration. 
Only 
nine 
extant 
genera 
are 
known 
as 
fossils, 
and 
we 
used 
the 
earliest 
known 
record 
of 
each 
of 
these 
as 
calibration 
points 
in 
our 
supertree. 
A 
patchy 
fossil 
record 
meant 
that 
many 
branches 
of 
our 
tree 
had 
no 
reliable 
fossil 
calibration 
dates, 
and 
we 
therefore 
used 
molecular 
estimates 
of 
divergence 
times 
for 
18 
additional 
genera39, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
entire 
family 
and 
the 
subfamily 
Culicinae. 
This 
method 
of 
supplementing 
fossil 
divergence 
dates 
with 
molecular 
dates 
was 
successfully 
used 
in 
a 
recent 
supertree 
of 
caridean 
shrimps54. 
Genera 
classified 


within 
Aedes 
in 
the 
classification 
of 
system 
of 
Wilkerson55 
were 
treated 
as 
Aedes 
during 
the 
time 
calibration. 
The 
node 
calibration 
dates 
are 
summarised 
in 
Supplementary 
Data 
1. 
The 
R 
packages 
Paleotree56 
and 
Strap57 
were 
used 
to 
scale 
and 
plot 
the 
supertree. 


Data 
on 
disease 
vectors. 
Data 
on 
the 
diseases 
vectored 
by 
each 
species 
of 
mosquito 
were 
obtained 
from 
Norbert 
et 
al.6. 
We 
also 
searched 
Web 
of 
Science 
for 
the 
names 
of 
all 
pathogens 
and 
the 
names 
of 
the 
diseases 
that 
they 
cause, 
coincident 
with 
any 
of 
the 
stems: 
vect*, 
transmit*, 
mosquit*, 
culicid*, 
pathog* 
or 
vir*. 
All 
of 
the 
sources 
consulted 
are 
listed 
in 
Supplementary 
References 
(Part 
2), 
while 
the 
resulting 
list 
of 
vectors 
and 
diseases 
is 
available 
as 
Supplementary 
Data

Speciation 
rate 
and 
correlations. 
Speciation 
rate 
parameters 
were 
modelled 
on 
the 
time-calibrated 
tree 
using 
BAMM12. 
We 
sampled 
four 
MCMC 
chains 
of 
10 
million 
generations 
every 
10,000 
iterations, 
with 
a 
burn-in 
of 
10%, 
for 
each 
phylogeny. 
Full 
analytical 
parameters 
and 
settings 
are 
given 
in 
Supplementary 
Note 
1, 
while 
the 
sampling 
file 
is 
provided 
as 
Supplementary 
Note 
2. 
The 
R 
package 
BAMMtools58 
was 
then 
used 
to 
identify 
significant 
speciation 
rate 
shifts 
across 
the 
entire 
tree 
(all 
Culicidae), 
and 
for 
the 
subclades 
Anophelinae 
and 
Culicinae. 
We 
also 
modelled 
vector 
and 
non-vector 
species 
separately. 
Speciation 
rates 
through 
time 
were 
modelled 
using 
both 
. 
and 
µ 
parameters 
and 
then 
tested 
in 
both 
. 
and 
µ 
calculations. 
Global 
temperature 
data 
and 
R 
code 
were 
derived 
from 
Davis 
et 
al.10. 
Atmospheric 
CO2 
concentration 
data 
were 
acquired 
from 
Bergman 
et 
al.59 
(Supplementary 
Data 
3). 
For 
the 
DCCA 
analysis, 
we 
used 
a 
window 
for 
temperature 
and 
CO2 
concentration 
data 
from 
200 
mya 
to 
the 
present. 
DCCA 
correlations 
of 
all 
realisations 
of 
the 
speciation 
curve 
in 
the 
MCMC 
analysis 
(9000 
data 
pairs 
in 
total) 
were 
performed 
for 
all 
Culicidae 
and 
the 
subclades 
against 
the 
temperature 
and 
atmospheric 
CO2 
concentration 
curves. 
Specifically, 
we 
tested 
whether 
the 
distribution 
of 
all 
9000 
correlation 
coefficients 
differed 
from 
the 
null 
hypothesis 
of 
zero, 
which 
implies 
no 
correlation. 
The 
correlations 
between 
clade 
(subfamily 
and 
vector/non-vector) 
and 
tip 
speciation 
rates 
were 
tested 
using 
the 
pgls 
function 
implemented 
in 
R 
package 
caper60. 


Information 
transfer. 
Information 
Theory 
has 
previously 
been 
used 
to 
explore 
causality 
in 
palaeontological 
and 
geological 
data 
sets 
with 
great 
success. 
Transfer 
entropy 
(TE) 
is 
a 
directional 
information 
flow 
method 
that 
quantifies 
the 
coherence 
between 
continuous 
variables 
in 
time61. 
It 
is 
an 
extension 
of 
the 
mutual 
information 
method, 
but 
can 
take 
into 
account 
the 
direction 
of 
information 
transfer 
by 
assuming 
that 
the 
processes 
can 
be 
described 
by 
a 
Markov 
model. 
Transfer 
Entropy 
reduces 
to 
a 
linear 
Granger 
causality 
process 
(whereby 
a 
signal 
in 
one 
time 
series 
gives 
a 
linear 
response 
to 
the 
second 
time 
series) 
when 
the 
two 
time 
series 
can 
be 
linked 
via 
autoregressive 
processes. 
However, 
TE 
makes 
fewer 
assumptions 
regarding 
the 
linearity 
of 
the 
processes 
involved, 
and 
is 
therefore 
more 
suitable 
for 
analysing 
causality 
when 
the 
processes 
involved 
are 
unknown62,63. 
Transfer 
Entropy 
is 
calculated 
using:

where 
TX.Y 
is 
the 
TE 
from 
time 
series 
X 
to 
time 
series 
Y, 
both 
of 
which 
have 
data 
at 
time 
n, 
and 
k 
and 
l 
are 
the 
embedding 
dimensions 
of 
the 
two 
time 
series 
respectively. 
As 
in 
Davis 
et 
al.64, 
we 
used 
the 
R 
(R 
Core 
Team 
2017) 
package 
TransferEntropy65 
which 
implements 
the 
above 
equation 
using 
a 
nearest 
neighbour 
algorithm66. 
This 
function 
returns 
a 
numeric 
value 
where 
0 
indicates 
no 
information 
transfer, 
positive 
numbers 
indicate 
information 
transfer, 
and 
negative 
numbers 
indicate 
misinformation 
transfer. 
The 
latter 
implies 
that 
there 
are 
other, 
unspecified 
processes 
interacting29. 
The 
embedding 
dimensions 
of 
the 
time 
series 
were 
estimated 
using 
the 
R 
package 
nonlinearTseries67. 


We 
calculated 
TE 
for 
four 
time 
series: 
speciation 
rate 
in 
Culicidae, 
speciation 
rate 
in 
Mammalia, 
global 
palaeo-temperature 
and 
atmospheric 
CO2. 
We 
derived 
TE 
values 
from 
each 
climatic 
variable 
to 
each 
taxon 
and 
also 
between 
mosquitoes 
and 
mammals, 
in 
both 
directions 
of 
putative 
transfer. 
The 
mammalian 
speciation 
rate 
time 
series 
was 
inferred 
from 
a 
BAMM 
analysis 
of 
a 
recent, 
almost 
complete 
mammal 
phylogeny68. 
The 
significance 
of 
TE 
values 
was 
determined 
by 
randomising 
the 
source 
time 
series 
250 
times 
to 
create 
surrogates, 
and 
leaving 
the 
target 
time 
series 
unchanged. 
If 
the 
TE 
value 
was 
outside 
the 
95% 
interval 
of 
the 
surrogate 
TE 
values, 
it 
was 
deemed 
significant69. 


Speciation 
rates 
verification. 
Molecular 
trees 
of 
Culicidae 
and 
Anophelinae 
were 
built 
using 
data 
from 
previous 
studies. 
The 
data 
set 
underpinning 
the 
phylogeny 
of 
Culicidae 
was 
obtained 
from 
Reidenbach 
et 
al.39, 
and 
comprised 
six 
nuclear 
gene 
protein-coding 
genes 
(arginine 
kinase, 
CAD, 
catalase, 
enolase, 
hunchback 
and 
white) 
coded 
for 
25 
ingroup 
genera 
and 
2 
outgroup 
taxa. 
The 
data 
set 
underpinning 
the 
tree 
of 
Anophelinae 
comprised 
three 
mitochondrial 
genes 
(COI, 
ND2, 
ND3) 
sequenced 
for 
19 
ingroup 
and 
2 
outgroup 
species. 
The 
subgenera 
Cellia, 
Nyssorhynchus, 
Anopheles, 
Lophopodomyia, 
Kerteszia 
and 
Stethomyia 
each 
had 
2 
-4 
representatives. 
Genbank

the
